# About Endless Sky

Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or
completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the
weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil
war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose
culture is more civilized than your own...

---

Endless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape
Velocity, or Star Control. You start out as the captain of a tiny space ship and
can choose what to do from there. The game includes a major plot line and many
minor missions, but you can choose whether you want to play through the plot or
strike out on your own as a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.

See the [player's manual][manual] for more information, or the [home
page][homepage] for screenshots and the occasional blog post.
