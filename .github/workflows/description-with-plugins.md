# Save Game Compatability

> **Before playing:** for existing save games verify the release date of this fork with your version of continuous.  The release of this fork should be the same date or newer otherwise you may face save game incompatilibites.

This game includes missions and campaigns not available in continuous.  If you decide to go back to continuous then the added outfits, ships, and missions will no longer be available.

Additional missions are also provided by plugins.  If you enable plugins they may change save game data and your save may be tied to them in order to work properly.

# Plugins

Endless Sky mods are called plugins.

This build comes with pre-packaged plugins which have been disabled by default.

You can enable plugins in-game by going to _Preferences > Plugins_ and enabling the plugin to load.  You'll need to restart in order to load the plugins.

# New Features in this fork

### New Mechanics

[Fleet mining: focused fire on asteroids](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/6669)

<details><summary>See feature details for fleet mining (click to expand)</summary>

---

- New shortcut `V` with a dual purpose
  - If you have asteroid scanning outfits, it will select the nearest asteroid.
  - `V` shortcut will toggle Harvest mode which means your fleet will collect harvested asteroids.  Your feel will also retrieve abandoned cargo from destroyed ships in harvest mode.
- `F` shortcut (focus fire) works on asteroids, your fleet will attack asteroids to mine them.  Your player ship must have asteroid scanning to select asteroids.
- A new preference for fighters transferring cargo to carried ships.
- A new preference for targeting asteroids based on highest value or proximity.

[Low powered fighters and non-combat fighter AI enhancements](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/6726)

<details><summary>See feature details for low powered fighters (click to expand)</summary>

---

- Player ship, escorts, fighters, and drones can be powered only by batteries.  (No power gen)
- Carrier Tanker Refueling AI
  - When you have a carrier with lots of fuel and fighters or drones with fuel pods they can be used to refuel your escort fleet.
  - Your fleet can focus on combat while the carrier tanker can refuel them.
  - Smart refueling behavior: All ships get 1 jump first, then all escorts get 100% refueled, then all mission NPC escorts get 100% refueled.  Finally, when all escorts are refueled the fighters or drones help to refuel the parent carrier ship back to full for the next refueling run.
- Ship recovery AI updates
  - Ships out of battery will become disabled and can call for help for a recharge.  This includes escorts and the player flagship.
  - Battery powered fighters and drones will automatically return to carriers to recharge.  This includes low powered fighters which have battery and small amounts of energy generation.
  - Battery powered fighters sharing energy with other ships during recovery operations reserve enough energy to be able to return to parent carriers.  This enables battery powered fighters and drones to be effective when aiding in disabled ship recovery.
  - Fighters and drones can recover other ships and drones (including battery powered fighters and drones).  This is useful when mining in the ember wastes with battery powered fighters and drones.
  - Carriers will recover their own carried ships which were disabled during battle.
  - All ships (including carriers) will recover disabled fighters and drones which are not carried by them.  This enables fighters associated with destroyed carriers to find a new home in a new carrier with empty bays.
- "No suicide pact" for defenseless fighters AI updates
  - Fighters will refuse to launch if they have no weapons and there are enemies in the system.
  - Fighters will retreat and re-dock with carrier if they have no weapons and enemies enter the system.
  - Minimum 10 second flight time.  Fighters will refuse to deploy if they do not have sufficient energy for 10 seconds of flight time overall.  This includes worst case scenario of using weapons the entire time.
    - Vulnerable fighters are less vulnerable in battle (like boxwings) because they stay docked.
    - Fighters will only deploy if their outfits allow them sufficient flight time in battle.
- Anti-Missile Defense AI updates
  - Fighters equipped with anti-missile and no weapons will still deploy since they're not considered completely defenseless.  Their purpose is to defend the parent carrier.
  - Fighters equipped with anti-missile and no weapons should not move when player issues orders for fleet to attack enemy.  They should keep station by their parent carrier to defend the carrier from missile attacks.

[Asteroid scanner auto-catalog asteroids while traversing systems](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/7103)

<details><summary>See feature details for auto-catalog asteroids (click to expand)</summary>

---

- By having an asteroid scanner installed, outfitter map menu is automatically updated with all asteroids within scan range without the player needing to target or harvest.
- Adding more asteroid scanners will improve scan range and make auto-catalog more effective.

</details>

---

[Bugfix Overly aggressive Government surveillance](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/7229)

<details><summary>See feature details for Government surveillance fix (click to expand)</summary>

---

- In remnant space, fixes surveillance ships switching targets too fast before scan completes which causes a swarm of ships around player fleet.
- Governments will only scan outfits or cargo of an ally fleet only if it hasn't seen it before in that system.  It will not attempt to scan multiple times if the local government has already scanned it.  Ships from multiple governments will attempt to scan independently of each other in a system they can surveil.  Cargo scanning and outfit scanning is tracked separately.

</details>

### New Content

Finally, new content is added by the above pull requests as well as [Bays as outfits engine support](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/6792) and [fighter and drone bay outfits](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/6793) pull requests.

  - Tutorials for fleet mining.
