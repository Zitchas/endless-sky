# FINAL THOUGHTS:
# One downside of doing things this way is the inability to use text replacements. If you want a different mineral, you have to change it all.
# There's also no way to make them "procedural", as far as I know, due to the fact that minerals are tied to outfits.
# One advantage this system has is (as shown in the mixed delivery) you can mix multiple requirements, so you could have missions that require an entire collection of minerals (copper, silver, and gold, in said example).
