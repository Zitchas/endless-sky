			`On Geminus you are met at the spaceport by Andre, who turns out to be almost a caricature of the classic scientist: Thin, slighly balding, a slightly frazzled look as if he was recently charged with static electricity, and a white lab coat. Unlike the carricature scientist, however, he radiates an air of calm confidence at odds with his appearance, and the military fatigues and combat boots suggest that he is Navy first, researcher second.`
			`	"Welcome to Geminus, Captain <last>!" It is a pleasure to meet you." He nods politely, and gestures for you to follow him. A few hallways and checkpoints later, and you find yourself in a conference room. "Thank you for accepting our request to consult on this project. Now, I'm sure you have some questions, so I'll get straight to it." He taps a button, and a projector lights up, displaying an image of a Sestor fleet. "Several months ago you were instrumental in defeating a flood of robotic alien warships that swept across Northern Republic space." He flicks through several slides showing long range phtography, scans, and video footage of various Sestor ships. "While we have known about the Hai for quite some time, it was quite a shock to be invaded by a hithertoo unknown race. After so many years of peaceful coexistence with the Hai and the Quarg, a warlike group caught us by surprise."`
			`	He flips through a few more slides, these ones show the broken husks of Sestor ships, wrecks, and some salvaged outfits spread out on a tarmac. "As a result, Parliament has seen fit to significantly increase the Navy's R&D budget. This, combined with the salvage and debris we have collected from theses 'Sestor' ships has allowed several of our long-standing projects to accelerate." He turns towards you. "This is where you come in: You have more combat experience against the Sestor than any other captain we know of. We would like you to inspect a new weapon we have developped, observe a weapons demonstration test, and then give us your thoughts on how effective it will be against the Sestor. So, do you accept?"`
			choice
				`	"I accept."`
					goto briefing
				`	"Sorry, I'm not interested."`
			`	Andre looks dissapointed, but accepting. "In which case, the Navy thanks you for your time, and we'll just end this here." He escorts you back through the checkpoints to the main spaceport, and bids you farewell.`
				decline
			label briefing
			`	Andre looks please. "Excellent. For this next part, it is probably easiest to just show you." He gets up, and leads you down the stairs to a large hangar. Flipping a switch, the banks of light start to flicker on, revealing the largest turret you have ever seen in human space.`
