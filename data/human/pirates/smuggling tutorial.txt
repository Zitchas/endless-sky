This time the beggar is - from what you can observe that isn't concealed by bandages - a young man scarcely beyond his teens, what of his skin remains visible marked by a painful looking pattern of burns. Both hands and the entire right half of his head are wound in bandages, and his entire body carries a strong odor of disinfectants and salve; not strictly unpleasant, but still bordering on the overpowering.`
