	description `The Ravager was the last crewed warship the Korath designed before they switched to drone ships. Neither side knows who originated the design; each kept capturing the others' ships and reverse-engineering improvements. This unending design competition bred a ship uncharacteristically efficient for the Korath. Unfortunately, its vast crew requirement leaves little space for passengers, cargo, or outfits. Ravagers can handle a phenominal arsenal and enough engines to out-maneuver the fastest drones, but not both at the same time.`

The Dredger was their first new ship: abundant cargo and passenger space, bays for four fighters, and seven turrets. It even has a small built-in nanite-run factory to refine ore, and repair the ship during battle. Its failing was its expense; Korath Raiders can be built four times as quickly."

	description "The Korath Exiles built these vast ships as their main population centers. In addition to living space, each Korath Haven has industrial and hydroponics capacity sufficient for bare subsistence of its inhabitants. During battle, the built-in nanite-run factories repair the ship, recharges shields, and provides powerful ramscoops."
