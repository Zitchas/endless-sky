			`You land by the starport and is immediately accosted by a Remnant who informs you that Prefect Chilia is on his personal warship before escorting you to a nearby starling. Inside you find Chilia and several other Remnants clustered around a holographic display and some display panels. "Ah, Captain. Join us, please." Chilia gestures for you to join them around the displays. As you approach, you note that the holographic display shows the Ember Waste, although there are a few details that do not match normal star maps.`
			`	Chilia notices you eyeing the deviations. "Perceptive, captain. Our sensors have reported some unusual energy signatures coming from this location. Scouts in the area says they are picking up signs of a new system. Unfortunately, they could neither locate neither a hyperlane nor a wormhole that would allow them to reach it." He looks up at you. "We are hoping that you might be able to figure out a way in."`

			`As the sensors re-establish their depiction of the system around you, an alien station immiediately becomes apparent. It appears to be old and mostly inactive, but your sensors do pick up ocasional bursts of energy. Oddly, your sensors are reporting faint signs of life almost everywhere.`

			`As you arrive back at Viminal you broadcast a warning to the port authorities that you have something following you. You inform them that it isn't hostile, but it is an unknown that originated in the new system.`

			`Quite a number of Remnants have gathered around the Spaceport, watching the movements of the strange creature. It gestures wildly in various ways, then freezes in several different positions with the tips of certain tentacles glowing with energy. You note that several anti-air batteries are in position around the area in case the creature becomes violent.`
			`	After several hours of watching the creature, one captain pushes his way forward to where you, Chilia, and Plume are talking. "I think I have an idea about this thing, Prefect!" the man signs excitedly. "Look at the positions of the glowing tips when it freezes. That pattern there matches the star positions of the main Ember Waste systems when viewed from Peragenor, and that second matches Convector." He pulls out a datapad and pulls up a projection of the starmap. "It is hard to tell due to the imprecision, but it looks like the third freeze is probably Antevorta or Nenia."`
			`	Plume chimes in "If those freezes indicate star positions, then the flying and landing behavior in between them may be indicating it wants you to go. Will you give it a try?"`

		dialog `The creature comes to a stop in front of you, spins around briefly, then spreads out its tentacles in another pattern. Following the Remnant's intuition, you match it to your star charts as probably being Convector. After holding the position for a minute, the creature realigns itself and starts to shimmer with the tell-tale signs of starting to make a jump, but it holds it, as if waiting for you.`
	on enter Convector
		dialog `It seems the analysis of the location was right. The creature quickly approaches you and repeats its previous dance, ending up with a slightly different frozen position. From this vantage, you suspect that it is probably Nenia. This time, as you watch it more closely, it looks like it is following in your wake somehow.`
	on enter Nenia
		dialog `You have never seen such activity from the Void Sprites. Many quickly congregate around the strange ship, and seem to escort it to Nasqueron. It seems like that is where it wanted to be. In the distance, you can see the Archon methodically pulverizing a Korath ship, presumably another Raider.`

			`You follow the creature down through the clouds of Nasqueron and emerge into what can only be described as an amphitheater in the clouds. Thousands of void sprites fill the area and the creature you have been following floats near the center of it. Your external sensors pick up myriad pulses of energy and eerie whistling noises that seem to resonate in the clouds. As the <ship> moves forward there is a sudden silence and the flickers of energy synchronize.`
			`	You feel a sudden pressure in your mind, and a sense of presence as the world around you fades out somewhat.`
			`	"Know you not, do I. Live creature inside dead creature, like ones who flew but not everywhere." You are momentarily disoriented as you look around and see hundreds of views of yourself peering out the cockpit window. "Your intention reverberates - Know and not know - Return with more echoes - perhaps I shall hear."`
			`	With that, the pressure vanishes and you are left staring out the window at the rapidly dispersing flock of void sprites. You aren't entirely sure what the voice meant, but you are quite sure that the Remnant are going to want to hear about this.`

			`It is almost starting to feel commonplace to have Remnant pouncing on your ship and using your cockpit as a meeting room. This time, it is Prefect Chilia and Plume who seem to appear out of nowhere requesting permision to board. The two gather around your console to watch the recording of your trip. They nod at your narration of what transpired, and focus intently when you describe the strange presence in your mind. When you finish recounting your experience, they lean back in thought.`
			`	"Captain <first>, the exact meaning is unclear, but it seems to be the voice of something not accustomed to speaking to us or creatures like us. Regardless, I think we should move forward with our plan," signs Prefect Chilia. "Best case scenario, we can deprive the Korath of easy access to the void sprites. Worst case scenario, we can move enough that - should the Korath hunt them to the extinction in Nenia, they will continue to exist in our territory."`
			`	Plume signals his cautious agreement. "This message is intriguing, but I do not think it should be our first priority. That being said, perhaps we should send along some additional remnant who can focus on the possibilities of more such messages."`
			`	The two look at you, and Chilia signs authoratively, "We are evacuating a large group of void sprites from Nenia to Esquiline. The atmospheres are largely a match, and we have reconfigured the station to provide the nutrients that aren't otherwise present. We have a fleet of Pelicans that have basically been hollowed out so we can lure as many void sprites into it as we can."`

			`	Plume looks a bit embarrassed. "Centuries ago when we first studied the void sprites, we learned how to harvest them. As part of that, we discovered that they were particularly interested in certain types of radiation. Likewise, if they discovered a certain kind of element common in some asteroids, they would ignore almost everything while they chewed on it. So, we have emitters inside the cargo holds, along with asteroids to keep them busy for a short while."`

				`	"Are we sure this is a good idea?"`

					goto letsgo

			`	Chilia signs with a resolute tone. "Is it a good idea? Maybe, maybe not. Is it the best idea we have so far? Yes." He sighs, "I fully expect the Archon to interfere: they do have long memories. As best we can tell, they can pick out who is leading a fleet, so you should expect to have them talking to you. That is, if they do not simply start shooting, anyway."`
			label letsgo
			`	Chilia continues "You don't need to actually land anywhere in Nenia this time, Captain. Just make sure the Pelicans get there, loadup, and return safely." The two stand up and get ready to leave. "May the Embers burn bright for you, Captain." With that, they disembark and quickly clear the blast area around the landing pad. Around you a large group of pelicans are warming up, each one connecting in to your IFF and confirming their status."`
