			`Strolling into the starport, you wonder if someone from the nosy gull would be approaching you. While you have made the approach to <planet> many times, this time was differentiated by a gull that seemed to be shadowing you closely. Just looking at it, you guessed that it was probably a reconnaissance ship, or possibly a science vessel. Few other ships would carry quite so much scanning equipment.`
			`	Looking around, you quickly notice a young Remnant trotting into the area from a different landing pad. He spots you and approaches, then clears his throat nervously "Greetings, traveler" he warbles, as if unused to singing. "We scanned you as you flew by, and noticed some unusual technology mounted to your hull. Can you tell us what they are?" With this, he pulls up his commlink and shows you an image of what appear to be your ramscoops.`

				`	"Those are wanderer ramscoops."`
				`	"I'd rather not share that."`
					decline
			
			`	"They are?" He looks disappointed. "I guess I'll be taking Mala's next watch duty, then. She guessed that they were ramscoops, I thought they were a scanning array." He looks slightly disappointed, but quickly regains his usual impassivity. "You said 'Wanderer' ramscoops? Who are these 'Wanderers?' Are they a group like us, hidden away somewhere?"`
			choice
				`	"Wanderers are an alien race that live in counter-spinward from humanity."`
				`	"I would prefer to not talk about them."`

			`	He listens to your explanation calmly, but his tone takes on a note of eagerness as he chants "These Wanderers sound very interesting. Thank you for telling me about them. It seems that we might have much that we could learn from them." He looks thoughtful for a moment before continuing.`

			`	"Be that as it may, the opportunity to study the fuel generation systems from someone with a different technological path would be most advantageous. If you could procure two of these 'Wanderer Ramscoops' for us, we would reimburse you for the cost, plus 750000 credits for your efforts."`

				`	"Sure, I could do that."`

			`Following the directions of the starport director, you land on the designated pad. A few minutes later a team of Remnant jog up with a flatbed transport following along behind. "Captain <first>? We were told to expect a delivery for the research labs" chants the man in the lead.`
			`	You nod an affirmative and gesture at the two Wanderer ramscoops. The team takes a few minutes to examine them and figure out how they are secured, then carefully loads them onto the flatbed trailer. As they finish securing it the leader taps on his commlink a few times then approaches you and offers a credstick. "As agreed, here is your payment, Captain."`
