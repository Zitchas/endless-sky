			`The crowd inside the spaceport cafeteria is an excited flurry of movement. You squeeze through a gap in the crowd to discover that they are gathered around a holoprojector displaying footage of the strange creature that recently followed you to Viminal and then on to Nenia. From the snippets of conversation that you catch, it appears that they are discussing theories about it. Almost as soon as you arrive, however, the gestures still and one of the Remnant gestures to you. "Greetings, Seeker. You are the one who found this creature. Since you traveled with it, could you share more recordings of it?"`
			choice
				`	"Definitely."`
				`	"Maybe later."`
					goto maybelater
			`	A few commands on your commlink later, and recordings your ship automatically made from its sensors while in flight pop up on a second projector. Several others pull up their commlinks and start skimming over the attached sensor logs. Almost immediately one waves to get everyone's attention.`
			`	"Captain, was there anything unusual when you arrived there?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, sensors reported life signs."`
				`	"I don't remember. Did you notice something?"`
			`	One of the Remnant pulls up the relevant section and puts it up on the projector. "Right here, the logs show that there is ambient life-signs all over the system, but nothing of significance shows up on the physical scanners." He frowns at the projector. "All the equipment status signals in the records are nominal, and both the check digits and data hashes match."`
			choice
				`	"So there is no problems with the data?"`
				`	"Skip the technical jargon. What does it mean?"`
					goto skiptech
			`	Another Remnant nods. "Exactly. There is no problem with the data or the equipment, so one way or another, this is what it recorded. As such, either there is something here which we have never seen before, or there is something causing problems with conventional sensors." He looks around at the gathered Remnant and pauses as if focusing on something you can't see or hear, then turns to you. "We have reached a consensus.`
				goto missionstatement
			label skiptech
			`	The Remnant pauses for a moment to adjust what they were about to say before continuing. "What it means is that there is no obvious explanation for why there would be life signs out there." They glance around at the rest of the gathered Remnant then back to you.`
			label missionstatement
			`	"We would like you to take a team of five researchers and their equipment to Ssil Vida. Can you do that?"`
			choice
				`	"That sounds reasonable."`
					goto takemission
				`	"Not right now."`
					goto maybelater
				`	"You aren't a prefect. How can you make a decision like that?"`
			`	Before he can respond, another Remnant answers. "The Prefects are not the sole source of decisions. One could say that they are the 'executive' authority that can make on-the-spot decisions, whereas the Remnant as a whole makes what one might term "legislative" decision making. The scope of our decisions as a group are limited based on the size of the group making the decision."`
			choice
				`	"That makes sense."`
					goto missionchoice
				`	"Why do you need multiple methods of decision making?"`
			`	"Because we are in the midst of war, and located in an actively hazardous part of the galaxy. We, as a people, need to make countless thousands of on-the-spot decisions every day. If we had to reach a consensus for every troop movement, expedition, or resource allocation we would be overwhelmed within days." She stops speaking, and another Remnant picks up the explanation.`
			`	"By the same token, prefects can be killed, or overloaded. Having as much decision making as possible handled by the Remnant as a group reduces our vulnerability to assassination strikes, and helps protect our prefects from burning out under the responsibility. On the flip side, it also protects our society from becoming an autocracy where one powerful person or small group makes all the decisions."`
			label missionchoice
			`	The Remnant still and look at you. "So, will you take this mission?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes."`
				`	"Later."`
					goto maybelater
			label takemission
			`	"Excellent. We will load our equipment racks on-board, and the equipment to go in them will be waiting for you on from pad D43A on <stopover>. Once it is loaded, return here to pick up the team of researchers who will be going with you. Remember, you will need 5 bunks free as well as an on-board research laboratory to complement our equipment."`

			`	In the cafeteria the scene hasn't changed much: There is still a large group of Remnant gathered around a cluster of projectors, with a constant stream of gestures discussing various points of the data. You understand enough to figure out that most of the conversation is deep into technical discussions of how the lifesign sensors might give the readings they do without having anything visible. The principle differences from before is that there is a stack of small bags and helmets next to the door and five of the Remnant present are wearing pressure suits. One of them notices you and waves you over. "Captain <first>! My name is Dusk, and I am one of the researchers that you volunteered to transport to Ssil Vida."`
			choice
				`	"Dusk? Are names of like that common?"`
				`	"Pleased to meet you, Dusk."`
					goto missiondescription
			`	"You mean names of the various phases of daylight?" He pauses for a few seconds. "I would not say they are common, but nor are they rare, either. Our ancestors devoted their lives, one way or another, to studying the stars and the ever-changing light of the universe. It should not be surprising that their vocabulary should be so entwined in our culture."`
			choice
				`	"Who were your ancestors?"`
				`	"Interesting. Well, what is our mission?"`
					goto missiondescription
			`	Dusk looks thoughtful for a moment. "Our ancestors came from a different era for humanity. They were the heirs of a golden age of human scientific progress and progress, when governments and institutions poured vast wealth into science. The developments of that time period resulted in the completion of the hyperspace relay network, new terraforming techniques, and advanced genetic engineering capabilities." His face clouds at that. "This, of course, culminated in the Alphas." He pauses, then shakes his head. "But you asked who are ancestors were, not about human history.`
			`	"In that era there were a number of burgeoning astronomy and exploration programs across human space. Despite also benefiting from the substantial budgets science in general as receiving, they were being pushed to the margins of the academic community: Unlike many of the more practical sciences like biology and chemistry which were coming up with new wonders, astronomy and astrophysics was purely academic. There was no budget in explaining the whys of the universe, not when other scientists were creating homo superior and unleashing instantaneous interstellar communication. So they banded together. It was not, I gather from the records, an unusual thing for academics of a particular field to meet with others of their field. If one faculty could not fund an expedition, perhaps two different faculties working together could. Eventually they formed a loose organization, a sort of 'standing conference' on astronomy and astrophysics, through which they met to discuss, debate, and organize."`
			choice
				`	"Your ancestors were originally a scientific conference?"`
				`	"Thanks for the background. So, what is our mission?"`
					goto missiontransition
			`	Several of the Remnant nod, and another signs. "They gathered together to talk of their science, and each brought with them the captains and crew who enabled them. Some of those captains brought with them resources, too. Who else would appreciate learning of the void as much as those who ply their trades across it? The association grew over time, although as best we can tell from our records it made an effort to remain both politically and economically neutral. As such, it remained comparatively small and close-knit. Many of our ancestors have told stories about calling themselves the 'Exploration Vector,' alluding to the fact that they were the one subset of humanity on a course to head out into the furthest reaches of space. They even held contests about who could go the furthest from inhabited space, or who could spend the longest time between resupply stops.`
			`	"When the war against the Alphas started, it was these people who had the most knowledge and experience with the farthest reaches of space. While many outfitters might sell a captain a map showing the hyperjumps a few systems into the uninhabited territories, it was our ancestors who had spent years living in those systems while they did their research. Thus they were the ones who got the jobs running supplies, or flying reconnaissance. They saw first-hand the way the war was going. They made the rendezvous' and picked up the equipment drops, and they grew increasingly worried."`
			choice
				`	"They were worried about the course the war was taking?"`
				`	"That would be worrisome. We should focus on the mission."`
					goto missiontransition
			`	Dust starts gesturing again. "Yes, but also by what they saw. Strange ships that slipped over the horizon, odd energy signatures in the distance, novel equipment that simply showed up on Deep ships without explanation... It seemed like someone out there was taking advantage of the chaos to influence humanity. Someone beyond the reach of the normal hyperspace network. It spurred our ancestors to revisit old theories and kindle new ones. Knowing that there was someone, something beyond what we knew made us bold. It was not long before the first ship travelled through the wormhole."`
			choice
				`	"Which ship was that?"`
				`	"I think I can see where this is going. Time to get to work."`
					goto missiontransition
			`	Dust smiles "The Shadow Step, an independent science vessel who did double-duty as a gas miner. She made a quiet fortune harvesting rarer gases from obscure gas planets off the charted paths. Never enough to attract the attention of the big corporate entities, but enough to be comfortable. Her captain was always making modifications. Not a genius by any means, but what they lacked in brilliance, they made up for in dedication and willingness to experiment. According to our records, making modifications to the Shadow Step was their main hobby, and the small crew she flew with had similar interests." Dust pauses to take a drink. "Thanks to the bravery of the Shadow Step and her crew, the hard work of the researchers that worked with them, and the contributions of a vast number of other ships and teams, the way out was discovered." Dust signs this last with a note of finality, and many of the Remnant who were listening make the sign for 'respect' and 'together.'`
			label missiontransition
			`	Dusk smiles and signs apologetically. "My apologies for being overly detailed. I found the study of our ancestors to be an intriguing one, so I have spent much time searching out my families' history. That, in turn, has led to a detailed interest in the early years of our society." Dust gestures towards the holo of Ssil Vida. "But enough of history, the present calls to us."`
			label missiondescription
			`	Dust leans over the holo, peering at the details. "The mission is a very standard arc: We go to the station, set up our equipment to get some detailed readings, and return here once we are done. For these initial readings we should need about a day onsite, and we will leave some of our equipment to take ongoing recordings for retrieval later. After that... Well, we will see what the data says and decide from there."`

			`Dusk and the team of scientists waste no time in getting to work: They have the preliminary sensors working almost from the moment you left the spaceport, and by the time you dock with Ssil Vida they have all their equipment arranged to quickly offload and setup. With the space cleared, they expand the research laboratory and set to work analyzing the system. Before long they are clustered around displays and adjusting sensor readings, deep in discussion. Eventually, Dusk strides over to you. "Everything is setup and proceeding nominally, Captain. We will need a few hours to complete the measurements, you do not need to stand around watching, although you are welcome to if you like." Dusk heads back over to check on one of the devices.`

			`	You pick up some instruments, recording equipment, and wayfinding labels, then check the map tracking the other Remnant researchers. Picking an unexplored direction, you set off.`
			`	The first few corridors are marked with labels indicating the direction that other explorers traveled. Picking an unmarked hallway, you put up a wayfinding label of your own, and set off along it. Almost immediately the sense of scale you noticed in the main room is reinforced, as you travel considerable distance between doorways. Glancing inside, you find room after room containing large platforms. Examining them, you find that each platform is lightly padded with several bars set into it along each side. At each end of the platform the surface has what you would guess to be storage lockers embedded in it. Based on your experience, you realize that these resemble storage platforms used to secure delicate cargo, but there is no indication of what that cargo might be.`
			`	Further exploration reveals considerably more oversized rooms, including one with vast amounts of storage lockers and freezers. You note that the rooms you search appear to be fairly well organized, so you conclude that either whatever happened to this station did not cause a panic, or someone else cleaned up afterwards. After a few hours exploring you head back to the main area.`

			`	You follow Dusk over to the equipment, and ask if there is anything you can do to help. He looks surprised, but pleased. After thinking about it for a moment, he asks you if you can help monitor some diagnostics and do some preventative maintenance on some of the equipment. Over the following few hours, Dusk keeps you involved in the work, occasionally explaining what the various pieces of equipment do. The rest of the team quickly follows suit, and before long you feel like part of the team. By the time Dusk starts wrapping up the observations you have started to pick up some of the scientific vocabulary, along with a few of the basics behind how the equipment works.`

We cannot run the main instruments without access to larger power sources such as your ship, but these smaller instruments will be able to record baseline data for us as well as documenting any sudden changes in some of the spectral emanations. They will provide useful data for us in the future." He smiles, then continues. "As the saying goes, the best time to start collecting data is a hundred years ago. The second best time to start collecting data is now."`

			`	The <ship> settles into the current landing pattern for the main spaceport on <destination> as you flip through the exterior camera feeds. In the distance, you notice that one of the research hangars has some activity going on around it, but otherwise the spaceport seems to be humming along as usual. Dusk stops by the cockpit as you settle the <ship> into its berth. "Thank you for helping us, <first>. It will take us some time to analyze this data, but we will likely be mounting another expedition to Ssil Vida in the near future." He pauses, then adds. "I do not think we ever mentioned it, but, as appropriate for your assistance, a logistics adjustment of <payment> has been applied to your account to cover your costs and provide resources to prepare for future endeavors."

				`	Not today.`
					decline

			`	You follow the stream of engineers and technicians to find Taely wedged into a cavity on what must be a ship. You cannot quite tell what it looks like, however, because it is still surrounded by scaffolding, tubes, and other systems. Whatever it is, it is quite small: Without all the construction rigging you suspect that it would probably be only slightly larger than a puffin. As you peer around the supports a Remnant scurries up with a slimy cable in a bag and hands it to you. "Here, Taely will need this in a few seconds, could you hand it to her when she asks for it? I need to go find the next part. Thanks!" The Remnant vanishes into an adjacent storage room before you even have the chance to respond. Almost immediately, however, Taely twists around to look back at you. "Oh, <first>! I was expecting Cora to be there with the... Ah, they gave it to you. Excellent. If you could just hand it up to me, it would be much appreciated." You reach up to hand her the bag, and Taely inches farther into the craft until only her feet are visible.

			`	She gestures to the ship next to her. "You have arrived in our space at an opportune time, <first>. While most of our developments over the years have been tweaking existing ships, tweaks can only go so far. Even before we established our first shipyard, we have been constantly innovating and trying out new ship designs. Every new development is put on the conceptual model to see if it can help us build a better ship." She grimaces slightly. "Well, that is a bit hyperbolic. Not every development applies to spacecraft, just the ones of most interest to me." She grins at that. "In any case, several of our development projects are nearing the point of production, and this prototype should be operational within a few days."`
			`	She pats a piece of exposed hull, and you think you can almost feel some kind of vibration or hum in response. Taely takes on a distant expression, as if lost in thought. After a long enough pause to feel awkward, she blinks a few times and focuses on you again. "Sorry about that. A new ship waking up and all that." She smiles, thoughtfully. "Before I get absorbed in my work again, would you be able to make a delivery for me? It is a simple one, but important. I need someone to deliver a crate of data files to <destination>. As my development project has reached its end, it is time to send a hard copy of the data to one of our archives for safe keeping. Could you deliver it for me?"`

			`	Taely looks please. "Excellent. Just delivers this to the archive on <destination>." She hands you a very robust looking datacrystal. "Looks a bit different from other data crystals, I am sure." She pauses. "These are archival crystals, and as such they have more robust data structures with many more layers of redundancy and error correction. Likewise, they have many additional layers of encryption and security to ensure that it does not fall into enemy hands. In other words, perfect for long-term storage." She pauses and smiles.

Inside, he pauses and gestures "I would recommend you hold onto the rails, and either hook your feet onto the toeholds or activate the magnets in your boots, if you have them. The drop is quite sudden." Looking around, you note that there are what look like toeholds bolted to the floor around the edge of the room, and your guide has inserted his feet into one pair.`
			`	As soon as you gesture that you are ready, the floor seems to drop out from below you. It seems as though you are in an elevator dropping down so fast that you are experiencing negative g forces.

			`	Outside the elevator, the Remnant leads you down a short hallway with many doors, and eventually it opens onto a larger hall. At the opposite end of the hall is a massive door flanked with several large devices that look remarkably similar to Point Defense Turrets, but subtly different. Your guide takes a few steps into the room, and a short pedestal pops out of the floor near him. He pulls a license out of his pocket, places it in the slot, and presses firmly on it for a second, before removing it once again.`
			`	He then walks briskly across the hall, gesturing you to follow. Shields flare in and out of existence around the two of you, forming a series of openings that allow you to approach the vault door, which opens when you reach it. Inside is a disappointingly small room with a small tray on a pedestal.`
			`	"If you would place the data crystal here, we will record the surface metadata, and those who need it will be able to retrieve it when necessary."

				`	"Those turrets looked different"`
			`	The Remnant nods. "You are observant. Most of those turrets are, in fact, the originals that we discovered here. Each one is a veritable fortress in and of itself, which is why we built similar ones to use as point defence systems for our ships.`
			choice
				`	"Originals?"`
				`	"You did not build the vault?"`
					goto buildvault
				`	"What do you mean by fortress?"`
					goto fortress
			`	"Yes, originals. As in, they were built by those who lived here before us, and survived countless eons protecting these hidden vaults. Even after so much time, they were still sufficiently functional to be formidable obstacles. We have since repaired them and learned much, including a lot that we have yet to be able to put into practice." He sighs, but makes a gesture of anticipation. "If we can master even half the science that made these, we will be able to achieve things that would seem like magic to those still on the ancestral worlds."`

				`	"But you produce these turrets for use on ships..."`
				`	"What about the Point Defence Turrets on your ships?"`
			`	"There is a big difference between being able to make something that looks similar, and being able to recreate something perfectly. The elements that we have formed into the defence turrets are actually the simplest and least advanced pieces of these ancient protectors." He shakes his head. "Someday, though. We are making new breakthroughs all the time."`
				goto departure

			`	The Remnant's gestures take on a tone of curiosity. "We are not sure what they are intended to hold, but their design includes a lot of passageways and chambers that resemble a hive or a miniature city. Some have speculated that the vault builders might have been miniscule beings, which would mean that these protective devices might well have housed thousands of individuals." He shakes his head. "It must have been quite the feat to survive and prosper in a world where wildlife could annihilate a village in a single footstep." After allowing you a moment to absorb the implications, he turns back to the door. "Time to go, Captain. The sentries grow twitchy when people dawdle here."`

He nods appreciatively at the surrounding room. Taking a moment to look around, you note that the walls and floor join seemlessly, and are made of a dark metallic substance that seems to shimmer. After allowing you a moment to admire the view, he turns back to the door. "Time to go, Captain. We would not want the sentries to think you were dawdling here."`

You follow her example, and a few moments later the nearest merganser nudges your hand. You follow Taely's lead in running your hand along it, and you discover that - despite the slimy appearance - the ship skin is dry and smooth. The surface is clearly metallic, but you can feel it stretch and twist under your hand as the ship shifts and moves. You can feel pulsing vibrations not entirely unlike the ones you are used to on the <ship>, but with subtle fluctuations.`

			`	"Historically, we have relied on starlings to fill light combat roles here in the Ember Waste, but as we spread out through the galaxy finding new systems it stretches the number available for defense and patrols rather thin." She pauses, then continues. "Of course, we could just make more starlings, but our pool of specialized crew is not infinite either. The solution is these Mergansers. They are sufficiently advanced that they only require a single crew to operate, and have sufficient range to patrol significant amounts of the Ember Waste. This makes them ideal for escorting gulls on resource gathering expeditions, patrolling for incursions, and other uses. Perhaps most importantly, though, is that they are fast enough to chase down anything we have encountered out here so far."`
			`	She frowns a bit at that. Unfortunately, the weapons program is not moving as quickly as I would like, so the Merganser does not have the tackling ability that I was originally envisioning for it. But at least it is an adept hunter we can use to pursue our enemies.`
			choice
				`	"OK"`
					goto mergansermission
				`	"What is tackling?"`
			`	"In space combat, 'tackling' refers to the tactic of pinning down an enemy to make them vulnerable to the rest of the fleet. It can also refer to hindering a target's ability to move, run, or escape. You are probably familiar with the idea of using missiles or weapons with an impact force to disrupt an opponent's hyperjump. This is a prime example of tackling." She pauses, thoughtfully. "Our inhibitors are tackling weapons, but they are not sufficiently effective as far as I am concerned."`
			choice
				`	"Thanks for the explanation."`
					goto mergansermission
				`	"What is the problem with them?"`
			`	"Decisive strike capability, mostly." Her gestures take on a conciliatory tone. "They are excellent weapons for swarms of ships, or when mounted on a ship that can carry many of them. But when one only has the opportunity to land a few hits, they are insufficient to pin down their target. But that is an aside. For now, we should celebrate our new ships, and see what they can do." She pets the nearest Merganser lovingly.`

She pauses, her eyes take on a distant look for a second before she continues. "But you have returned with the flock intact. Come, join us for a meal and tell me how they fared."

Sometimes they poke various engineers or technicians, and the technicians frequently share messages from their commlinks. Apparently they have them hooked up to the Mergansers, so the ships are sharing their own accounts of the patrol. After several hours of the festivities, Taely announces that everyone needs to get to sleep because tomorrow is a new day. As everyone bids their farewells, you note that they include the ships, with most people patting or stroking one or more of the ships on their way out.`

Several technicians cling to the ceiling overhead as they install new conduit. Despite the busy atmosphere, people frequently stop to glance out the windows, and a flutter of gestures break out whenever someone spots a void sprite. Seeing how busy it is, you understand the traffic controler's request that you refrain from taking up a berth for longer than necessary.`
			`	You find Gavriil nearby, where he is going over a freshly installed hydroponics array with a pair of Remnant in tow. He quickly finishes and gestures farewell to the other two before walking over to you. "Greetings, Captain <first>! Welcome back to Esquiline, it has changed a bit since you were here last."

And they came with enough firepower to make life miserable for everyone. We only had a few scouts in the area, so we stayed hidden and bargained. In the end, they gave us some 'inconsequential' data, and they got an hour to explore the station and take a few loose items.

And it was doubly distressing for them that, despite their impressive scanner arrays, they were not able to even catch the slightest emission that might hint at where or who we were." He pauses as he palms open a door to pull the loaded lift through, then continues.

The data we received was raw, uncorrected, and continuous data covering multiple tens of thousands of years of stellar observations. The data even includes data that likely corresponds to the destruction of some of their worlds during their civil war." He pauses, then continues. "Of course, we need to verify the data first. So far, though, it is checking out succesffully against trusted data. If it can be validated, the data will massively expand the dataset our researchers can use to model and study the universe."`

He pauses, and is gestures take on a tone of disgust. "Of course, we are working to avoid that. But having multiple backup systems is the key to survival in hostile conditions." He looks around at the few Remnant who have yet to vanish into the rest of the station. "Thank you for bringing more explorers." He hands you a datacrystal. "I have already transmitted this data to Viminal, but I would appreciate it if you could take this to them to ensure there are no errors or data corruption.`

			`Not knowing who to deliver the data crystal to, you take it to the information desk. The Remnant currently working there gestures that they have been expecting it. They thank you for delivering it. As you leave the information desk, your commlink chimes with a message from prefect Chilia. It informs you that Chilia would like to speak with you, and is currently in the spaceport cafeteria.`

			`Chilia is just collecting his tray from the counter when you step into the cafeteria. Seeing you enter, he picks up a second one and nods towards a pair of open seats at a table with Taely and Dusk. "We are glad you could make it, <first>." Taely looks happy, brimming with contained energy. "It is an exciting day, Captain, but Dusk can start." She nods to Dusk, who sets down his fork to gesture. "While Gavriil has been making excellent progress setting up facilities on Ssil Vida, I hae been working with a team of xenolinguists on deciphering the data we have collected so far. Based on Gavriil's recommendations, we have been focussing on the power distribution system`
