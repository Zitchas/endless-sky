			`The crowd inside the spaceport cafeteria is an excited flurry of movement. You squeeze through a gap in the crowd to discover that they are gathered around a holoprojector displaying footage of the strange creature that recently followed you to Viminal and then on to Nenia. From the snippets of conversation that you catch, it appears that they are discussing theories about it. Almost as soon as you arrive, however, the gestures still and one of the Remnant gestures to you. "Greetings, Seeker. You are the one who found this creature. Since you traveled with it, could you share more recordings of it?"`
			choice
				`	"Definitely."`
				`	"Maybe later."`
					goto maybelater
			`	A few commands on your commlink later, and recordings your ship automatically made from its sensors while in flight pop up on a second projector. Several others pull up their commlinks and start skimming over the attached sensor logs. Almost immediately one waves to get everyone's attention.`
			`	"Captain, was there anything unusual when you arrived there?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, sensors reported life signs."`
				`	"I don't remember. Did you notice something?"`
			`	One of the Remnant pulls up the relevant section and puts it up on the projector. "Right here, the logs show that there is ambient life-signs all over the system, but nothing of significance shows up on the physical scanners." He frowns at the projector. "All the equipment status signals in the records are nominal, and both the check digits and data hashes match."`
			choice
				`	"So there's no problems with the data?"`
				`	"Skip the technical jargon. What does it mean?"`
					goto skiptech
			`	Another Remnant nods. "Exactly. There is no problem with the data or the equipment, so one way or another, this is what it recorded. As such, either there is something here which we have never seen before, or there is something causing problems with conventional sensors." He looks around at the gathered Remnant and pauses as if focusing on something you can't see or hear, then turns to you. "We have reached a consensus.`
				goto missionstatement
			label skiptech
			`	The Remnant pauses for a moment to adjust what they were about to say before continuing. "What it means is that there is no obvious explanation for why there would be life signs out there." They glance around at the rest of the gathered Remnant then back to you.`
			label missionstatement
			`	"We would like you to take a team of five researchers and their equipment to Ssil Vida. Can you do that?"`
			choice
				`	"That sounds reasonable."`
					goto takemission
				`	"Not right now."`
					goto maybelater
				`	"You aren't a prefect. How can you make a decision like that?"`
			`	Before he can respond, another Remnant answers. "The Prefects are not the sole source of decisions. One could say that they are the 'executive' authority that can make on-the-spot decisions, whereas the Remnant as a whole makes what one might term "legislative" decision making. The scope of our decisions as a group are limited based on the size of the group making the decision."`
			choice
				`	"That makes sense."`
					goto missionchoice
				`	"Why do you need multiple methods of decision making?"`
			`	"Because we are in the midst of war, and located in an actively hazardous part of the galaxy. We, as a people, need to make countless thousands of on-the-spot decisions every day. If we had to reach a consensus for every troop movement, expedition, or resource allocation we would be overwhelmed within days." She stops speaking, and another Remnant picks up the explanation.`
			`	"By the same token, prefects can be killed, or overloaded. Having as much decision making as possible handled by the Remnant as a group reduces our vulnerability to assassination strikes, and helps protect our prefects from burning out under the responsibility. On the flip side, it also protects our society from becoming an autocracy where one powerful person or small group makes all the decisions."`
			label missionchoice
			`	The Remnant still and look at you. "So, will you take this mission?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes."`
				`	"Later."`
					goto maybelater
			label takemission
			`	"Excellent. We will load our equipment racks on-board, and the equipment to go in them will be waiting for you on from pad D43A on <stopover>. Once it is loaded, return here to pick up the team of researchers who will be going with you. Remember, you will need 5 bunks free as well as an on-board research laboratory to complement our equipment."`
				accept
			label maybelater
			`	"Oh, that's unfortunate. Maybe some other time, then." The crowd makes various gestures of disappointment, and turn back to observing the projection and discussing their theories.`

			`	In the cafeteria the scene hasn't changed much: There is still a large group of Remnant gathered around a cluster of projectors, with a constant stream of gestures discussing various points of the data. You understand enough to figure out that most of the conversation is deep into technical discussions of how the lifesign sensors might give the readings they do without having anything visible. The principle differences from before is that there is a stack of small bags and helmets next to the door and five of the Remnant present are wearing pressure suits. One of them notices you and waves you over. "Captain <first>! My name is Dusk, and I am one of the researchers that you volunteered to transport to Ssil Vida."`
			choice
				`	"Dusk? Are names of like that common?"`
				`	"Pleased to meet you, Dusk."`
					goto missiondescription
			`	"You mean names of the various phases of daylight?" He pauses for a few seconds. "I would not say they are common, but nor are they rare, either. Our ancestors devoted their lives, one way or another, to studying the stars and the ever-changing light of the universe. It should not be surprising that their vocabulary should be so entwined in our culture."`
			choice
				`	"Who were your ancestors?"`
				`	"Interesting. Well, what is our mission?"`
					goto missiondescription
			`	Dusk looks thoughtful for a moment. "Our ancestors came from a different era for humanity. They were the heirs of a golden age of human scientific progress and progress, when governments and institutions poured vast wealth into science. The developments of that time period resulted in the completion of the hyperspace relay network, new terraforming techniques, and advanced genetic engineering capabilities." His face clouds at that. "This, of course, culminated in the Alphas." He pauses, then shakes his head. "But you asked who are ancestors were, not about human history.`
			`	"In that era there were a number of burgeoning astronomy and exploration programs across human space. Despite also benefiting from the substantial budgets science in general as receiving, they were being pushed to the margins of the academic community: Unlike many of the more practical sciences like biology and chemistry which were coming up with new wonders, astronomy and astrophysics was purely academic. There was no budget in explaining the why's of the universe, not when other scientists were creating homo superior and unleashing instantaneous interstellar communication. So they banded together. It was not, I gather from the records, an unusual thing for academics of a particular field to meet with others of their field. If one faculty could not fund an expedition, perhaps two different faculties working together could. Eventually they formed a loose organization, a sort of 'standing conference' on astronomy and astrophysics, through which they met to discuss, debate, and organize."`
			choice
				`	"Your ancestors were originally a scientific conference?"`
				`	"Thanks for the background. So, what is our mission?"`
					goto missiontransition
			`	Several of the Remnant nod, and another signs. "They gathered together to talk of their science, and each brought with them the captains and crew who enabled them. Some of those captains brought with them resources, too. Who else would appreciate learning of the void as much as those who ply their trades across it? The association grew over time, although as best we can tell from our records it made an effort to remain both politically and economically neutral. As such, it remained comparatively small and close-knit. Many of our ancestors have told stories about calling themselves the 'Exploration Vector,' alluding to the fact that they were the one subset of humanity on a course to head out into the furthest reaches of space. They even held contests about who could go the furthest from inhabited space, or who could spend the longest time between resupply stops.`
			`	"When the war against the Alphas started, it was these people who had the most knowledge and experience with the farthest reaches of space. While many outfitters might sell a captain a map showing the hyperjumps a few systems into the uninhabited territories, it was our ancestors who had spent years living in those systems while they did their research. Thus they were the ones who got the jobs running supplies, or flying reconnaissance. They saw first-hand the way the war was going. They made the rendezvous' and picked up the equipment drops, and they grew increasingly worried."`
			choice
				`	"They were worried about the course the war was taking?"`
				`	"That would be worrisome. We should focus on the mission."`
					goto missiontransition
			`	Dust starts gesturing again. "Yes, but also by what they saw. Strange ships that slipped over the horizon, odd energy signatures in the distance, novel equipment that simply showed up on Deep ships without explanation... It seemed like someone out there was taking advantage of the chaos to influence humanity. Someone beyond the reach of the normal hyperspace network. It spurred our ancestors to revisit old theories and kindle new ones. Knowing that there was someone, something beyond what we knew made us bold. It was not long before the first ship travelled through the wormhole."`
			choice
				`	"Which ship was that?"`
				`	"I think I can see where this is going. Time to get to work."`
					goto missiontransition
			`	Dust smiles "The Shadow Step, an independent science vessel who did double-duty as a gas miner. She made a quiet fortune harvesting rarer gases from obscure gas planets off the charted paths. Never enough to attract the attention of the big corporate entities, but enough to be comfortable. Her captain was always making modifications. Not a genius by any means, but what they lacked in brilliance, they made up for in dedication and willingness to experiment. According to our records, making modifications to the Shadow Step was their main hobby, and the small crew she flew with had similar interests." Dust pauses to take a drink. "Thanks to the bravery of the Shadow Step and her crew, the hard work of the researchers that worked with them, and the contributions of a vast number of other ships and teams, the way out was discovered." Dust signs this last with a note of finality, and many of the Remnant who were listening make the sign for 'respect' and 'together.'`
			label missiontransition
			`	Dusk smiles and signs apologetically. "My apologies for being overly detailed. I found the study of our ancestors to be an intriguing one, so I have spent much time searching out my families' history. That, in turn, has led to a detailed interest in the early years of our society." Dust gestures towards the holo of Ssil Vida. "But enough of history, the present calls to us."`
			label missiondescription
			`	Dust leans over the holo, peering at the details. "The mission is a very standard arc: We go to the station, set up our equipment to get some detailed readings, and return here once we are done. For these initial readings we should need about a day onsite, and we will leave some of our equipment to take ongoing recordings for retrieval later. After that... Well, we will see what the data says and decide from there."`
				accept
	on stopover
		conversation
			`Dusk and the team of scientists waste no time in getting to work: They have the preliminary sensors working almost from the moment you left the spaceport, and by the time you dock with Ssil Vida they have all their equipment arranged to quickly offload and setup. With the space cleared, they expand the research laboratory and set to work analyzing the system. Before long they are clustered around displays and adjusting sensor readings, deep in discussion. Eventually, Dusk strides over to you. "Everything is setup and proceeding nominally, Captain. We will need a few hours to complete the measurements, you do not need to stand around watching, although you are welcome to if you like." Dusk heads back over to check on one of the devices.`

				`	Return to the <ship> and prepare for departure.`
					goto relax
				`	Ask if you can help with their work.`
					goto scienceassistant
				`	Explore Ssil Vida.`
			apply explorationinterest += 1
			`	You pick up some instruments, recording equipment, and wayfinding labels, then check the map tracking the other Remnant researchers. Picking an unexplored direction, you set off.`
			`	The first few corridors are marked with labels indicating the direction that other explorers traveled. Picking an unmarked hallway, you put up a wayfinding label of your own, and set off along it. Almost immediately the sense of scale you noticed in the main room is reinforced, as you travel considerable distance between doorways. Glancing inside, you find room after room containing large platforms. Examining them, you find that each platform is lightly padded with several bars set into it along each side. At each end of the platform the surface has what you would guess to be storage lockers embedded in it. Based on your experience, you realize that these resemble storage platforms used to secure delicate cargo, but there is no indication of what that cargo might be.`
			`	Further exploration reveals considerably more oversized rooms, including one with vast amounts of storage lockers and freezers. You note that the rooms you search appear to be fairly well organized, so you conclude that either whatever happened to this station did not cause a panic, or someone else cleaned up afterwards. After a few hours exploring you head back to the main area.`
			goto wrapup
			label scienceassistant
			apply scienceinterest += 1
			`	You follow Dusk over to the equipment, and ask if there is anything you can do to help. He looks surprised, but pleased. After thinking about it for a moment, he asks you if you can help monitor some diagnostics and do some preventative maintenance on some of the equipment. Over the following few hours, Dusk keeps you involved in the work, occasionally explaining what the various pieces of equipment do. The rest of the team quickly follows suit, and before long you feel like part of the team. By the time Dusk starts wrapping up the observations you have started to pick up some of the scientific vocabulary, along with a few of the basics behind how the equipment works.`
			`	You help pack up the equipment, then head back to the main room where Dusk and several others are gathered.`
			goto wrapup
			label relax
			`	You head back to the <ship> and run through all the preliminary checks to get ready for the trip back to <destination>. You quickly finish the checks, along with some preventative maintenance, and end up spending a few hours relaxing while you wait for Dusk and his team to finish their studies.`
			`	Eventually you get a message from Dusk indicating that they are all packed up and ready to begin loading.`
			label wrapup
			`	You find Dusk in the main hall that opens directly off of the bay where the <ship> is docked. Remnant scurry around stacking equipment in preparation for loading, and a team appears to be setting up a number of instruments around the periphery of the room. Dusk spots you, and waves you over to where he appears to be checking the readings on a console.`
			choice
				`	"What are you doing now?"`
				`	"Ready to load up?"`
					goto loading
			`	Dusk smiles at you and gestures at the others setting up instruments around the edge of the room. "We are leaving these instruments here running automated data collection routines. We cannot run the main instruments without access to larger power sources such as your ship, but these smaller instruments will be able to record baseline data for us as well as documenting any sudden changes in some of the spectral emanations. They will provide useful data for us in the future." He smiles, then continues. "As the saying goes, the best time to start collecting data is a hundred years ago. The second best time to start collecting data is now."`
			label loading
			`	He gestures to the rest of the team, who immediately start loading the <ship>. "Well, it is time to head back." Dusk heads over to the equipment pile, and starts carrying equipment onboard.`

			`The trip back to <destination> goes quickly but quietly, as all the Remnant seem to be focused on writing reports of their observations. From what you can tell, each member of the team writes up their own observations and experiences, and then Dusk assembles all the reports into an expedition report that includes each researcher's verbatim report as well as his own.`
			`	The <ship> settles into the current landing pattern for the main spaceport on <destination> as you flip through the exterior camera feeds. In the distance, you notice that one of the research hangers has some activity going on around it, but otherwise the spaceport seems to be humming along as usual. Dusk stops by the cockpit as you settle the <ship> into its berth. "Thank you for helping us, <first>. It will take us some time to analyze this data, but we will likely be mounting another expedition to Ssil Vida in the near future." He pauses, then adds. "I do not think we ever mentioned it, but, as appropriate for your assistance, a logistics adjustment of <payment> has been applied to your account to cover your costs and provide resources to prepare for future endeavors." Dusk gives you a polite nod then heads off to help the other researchers unload the equipment.`
