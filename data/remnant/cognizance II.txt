		conversation
			`The crowd inside the spaceport cafeteria is an excited flurry of movement. You squeeze through a gap in the crowd to discover that they are gathered around a holoprojector displaying footage of the strange creature that recently followed you to Viminal and then on to Nenia. From the snippets of conversation that you catch, it appears that they are discussing theories about it. Almost as soon as you arrive, however, the gestures still and one of the Remnant gestures to you. "Greetings, Seeker. You are the one who found this creature. Since you traveled with it, could you share more recordings of it?"`
			choice
				`	"Deffinitely."`
				`	"Maybe later."`
					goto maybelater
			`	A few commands on your commlink later, and recordings your ship automatically made from its sensors while in flight pop up on a second projector that someone sets up. Several others pull up their commlinks and start skimming over the attached sensor logs. Almost immediatley one waves to get everyone's attention.`
			`	"Captain, was there anything unusual when you arrived there?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, sensors reported life signs."`
				`	"I don't remember, but I think you already spotted something."`
			`	One of the Remnant pulls up the relevant section and puts it up on the projector. "Right here, the logs show that there is ambient life-signs all over the system, but nothing physical shows up on the scanners." He frowns at the projector. "Now, all the equipment status signals in the records are nominal, and both the check digits and data hashes match."`
			choice
				`	"So there's no problems with the data?"`
				`	"Skip the technical jargon. What does it mean?"`
					goto skiptech
			`	Another Remnant nods. "Exactly. There is no problem with the data or the equipment, so one way or another, this is what it recorded. As such, either there is something here which we have never seen before, or there is something causing problems with conventional sensors." He looks around at the gathered Remnant and pauses as if focusing on something you can't see or hear, then turns to you. "We have reached a consensus.`
			label skiptech
			`	"We would like you to equip a research laboratory on your ship and take a team of five researchers to Ssil Vida. Can you do that?"`
			choice
				`	"That sounds reasonable."`
					goto takemission
				`	"Not right now."`
					goto maybelater
				`	"You aren't a prefect. How can you make a decision like that?"`
			`	Before he can respond, another Remnant answers. "The Prefects are not the sole source of decisions. One could say that they are the 'executive' authority that can make on-the-spot decisions, whereas the Remnant as a whole makes what one might term "legislative" decision making. The scope of our decisions as a group are limited based on the size of the group making the decision."`
			choice
				`	"That makes sense."`
					goto missionchoice
				`	"Why do you need multiple methods of decision making?"`
			`	"Because we are in the midst of war, and located in an actively hazardous part of the galaxy. We, as a people, need to make countless thousands of on-the-spot decisions every day. If we had to reach a consensus for every troop movement, expedition, or resource allocation we would be overwhelemed within days." She stops spaking, and another Remnant picks up the explanation.`
			`	"By the same token, prefects can be killed, or overloaded. Having as much decision making as possible handled by the Remnant as a group reduces our vulnerability to assasination strikes, and helps protect our prefects from burning out under the responsibility. On the flip side, it also protects our society from becoming an autocracy where one powerful person or small group makes all the decisions."`
			label missionchoice
			`	The Remnant still and look at you. "So, will you take this mission?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes."`
				`	"Later."`
					goto maybelater
			label takemission
			`	"Excellent. Pick up our supplies from this pad on <stopover> then return here to pick up the team of researchers who will be going with you. Remember, you will need 5 bunks free as well as an onboard research laboratory."`
				accept
			label maybelater
			`	"Oh, that's unfortunate. Maybe some other time, then." The crowd makes various gestures of disapointment, and turn back to observing the projection and discussing their theories.`
