	description "The Vulture is not a ship meant to be purchased in its current form. Eventually, this will be a Heavy Warship intended to be heavy tank complement to the Albatross, and a successor to it in terms of front-line survivability. Hence why it has fewer cannons, but more armor, shields, and space. Current stats are modeled after the Hurricane and Punisher. What stats it actually has will be determined by the state of the plot when it is added. In any event, it will be added via missions as a newly developped warship, much in the same way as the Dreadnought is in the FW campaign."

	description `The Condor is the Remnant's combat transport, and was  built to serve two purposes. The first is to carry soldiers and salage crew for boarding operations against the Korath. The second is to carry as many people as possible during evacuations under fire from Alphas, Korath, or other unknown threats. As a result of these mandates, the Condor is built to be tough, fast, and fit as many people as possible. Given its importance in keeping the Remnant safe during evactuations, it usually carries a pair of petrels with a small squad of terns to cover its retreat and distract enemies from that which the Remnant value far more than material wealth.`

Most of necessity will be in suspended animation, but it can support over a thousand active cew. These massive ships incorporate the latest of all remnant technology and are fully alive with a degree of sapience that puts them on equal terms with their crew. They are not servants of the remnant, they are one of them."`

	description "Upon hearing the news that the Korath Exiles had regained access to automata technology, the Remnant quickly realized that they would need a dedicated anti-swarm ship. Given tha the Albatross was overdue for an update, they decided to do so with an eye to creating an anti-fighter platform suited to close quarters combat."
	description "Remnant expertise in material sciences definitely shows in the Skua: While the shields are at roughly the same level as the Albatross, the hull is three times more durable. Perhaps more importantly, however, is that it can now cloak. Drawing on preliminary studies of the Void Sprites, the Skua is has been significantly reinforced to allow for greater strengths in terms of both compression and tension. As a result, it can handle a greater variety of internal configurations as well as the pressures generated from submersion deep in gas giants."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Skua's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."
