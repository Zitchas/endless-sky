	description "While their pursuit of the secrets of Jump Drives has yet to result in the successful manufacture of such a drive, it has led to many other advances. One such is the Quantum Tear. The Remnant look at you dubiously when you ask for an explanation as to how these work. When your eyes glaze over after the first sentence, they abbreviate the explantion to 'These weapons utilize a variant hyperspace manifold to create microtears in temporal substructures causing the rupture of their quantum state, resulting in the disruption of both internal and applied forces.'"
	description "	These massive weapons require special hardpoints, and are built in such few number that the Remnant distribute them directly to the captains they trust with them. Due to the prodigious energy and fuel requirements, only the most massive of Remnant ships can support regular use of these weapons."

While it is easy enough for affected ships to purge their tanks of the useless material, it will make substantial dents in their fuel reserves."

	description "In contrast to most of the galaxy, the Ember Waste is comparatively dense with the raw elements necessary for the production of fuel. Driven by the ever present fear that war is about to return to their desolate corner, the Remnant combined reverse engineered Deep technology with alien technology to provide improved sources of fuel to power their systems. The resulting system isn't quite as efficient as the Deep's design, but its compact size makes it much easier to fit onto almost any ship."

	description "Driven by fear that their corner of the galaxy is becoming less and less secretive, the Remnant are leaping upon every opportunity to innovate, steal, or cobble together fuel systems of ever increasing capacity. Their latest creation builds upon what they learned from the catalytic ramscoops with new techniques learned from the Wanderer ramscoops. While the Wanderer ramscoop creates a big field to pull in available matter, the Remnant use a set of nine small ramscoops spread out over the periphery of the ship to effectively generate a larger mesh to catch material, which is then rerouted back to a central processing unit. Some Remnant engineers consider this system effectively a way to let their ships breath in space."

While the equipment necessary to generate the cloak still can't be miniaturized enough for an individual to wear, these suits contain the beacons and tracking points to allow the main equipment integrated into the ship to project a tight cloaking field specific to its wearer. As a result, these suits can render combat-trained personnel extremely effective on or in very close quarters to their own ship.`

	description "Perhaps more important for some are the peripheral improvements over standard reactors. The most obvious improvement is that these generators produce stabilized byproducts suitable for use as hyperdrive fuel on a continuous basis. The less obvious feature is that they can nullify some of the ionization that a ship might be exposed to in the Ember Waste."
