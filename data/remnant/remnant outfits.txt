	description `These flak turrets date back to the era when the most serious thing planets needed to protect against was the ocassional pirate raid. Desperate for weaponry to fend of the Alphas, the Remnants salvaged many of these for their ships during their exodus.`
	description `	While these weapons are poor in terms of their direct damage potential, the Remnant keep them in service because of their utility at disrupting incoming fighter formations. They are now returning to service on ships in light of the recent swarm of automata that swept across parts of human space.`

	description "The GASER is the product of lengthy research into the field of spatially and temporally stabilized gamma rays produced through the use of di-positronium. Spurred by the acquisition of heavy lasers demonstrating new techniques used by the rest of humanity, Remnant researchers were able to significantly improve on these designs to create a highly effective beam weapon."
	description "While they were not able to eliminate the heat produced by the gaser canon using integrated cooling systems, these cooling systems are integrated so that they can provide continuous cooling to help minimize the thermally-induced downtime between firing."

	description `Nearly a century ago, a Remnant scout exploring space north of the Ember Waste came under fire from an alien fleet armed with weapons that interfered with the scout's engines. The story says that the Remnant captain calmly told her crew, "We aren't going home until we steal that weapon." That alien technology became the basis of the Inhibitor Cannon.`
	description `	Although the Remnant appreciated the original weapon, they were disappointed that it was too big to fit on most of their ships. Instead of letting their effort go to waste, they instead opted to put their newfound knowledge to use creating a weapon suitable for their more nimble craft. Thus, the Inhibitor is excellent at controlling engagement distances, keeping targets at range by both pushing them backward with the impact of each shot while also slowing their approach by interfering with their engines.`

	description `While cannons that can interfere with a ship's engines are useful in any situation, the Remnant quickly decided that it would be even more useful as a turret that their ships could use to impede those chasing after them. These small Inhibitor Turrets are typically found primarily on Pelicans trying to outrun opponents rather than defeat them.`
	description `Although these turrets are unremarkable in terms of performance, the comparatively recent perfection of a technique of installing the bulk of the weapon itself externally on the turret mount instead of under the base has resulted in a weapon that takes comparatively little outfit space. It does, however, still add quite a bit more to the mass of the ship.`

	description `With the advent of longer ranged weapons on Korath warships, it was determined that some sort of weapon was needed to fulfill the 'sniper' role in the Remnant fleets. The result was the creation of the Quantum Artillery - a cannon that utilizes deuterium fuel solidified into armor piercing shells designed to deliver a payload designed to erase the target's fuel reserves. These weapons are not particularly effective in terms of damage output, but they are very effective at crippling an enemy's ability to run or manouver.`

	description `This turret was designed and manufactured by a group of Remnant engineers who firmly believe the old motto "by many small things great things can be accomplished" In response to the automaton threat, they believe that taking a page from the Korath tactics by filling the skies with lethal shrapnel is one of the best ways to eliminate that threat.`
	description `More accurately, the Remnant Flak Turret launches projectiles that have been laced with particles that interfere with the passage of matter across the space/time fabric, resulting in a minor slowing effect that helps ensure that enemy swarms cannot effectively maneuver.`

	description "While their pursuit of the secrets of Jump Drives has yet to result in the successful manufacture of such a drive, it has led to many other advances. One such is the Quantum Tear. The Remnant look at you dubiously when you ask for an explanation as to how these work. When your eyes glaze over after the first sentence, they abbreviate the explantion to 'These weapons utilize a variant hyperspace manifold to create microtears in target particles causing the rupture of their quantum state, resulting in the disruption of both internal and applied forces.'"
	description "	These massive weapons require special hardpoints, and are built in such few number that the Remnant distribute them directly to the captains they trust with them. Due to the prodigious energy and fuel requirements, only the most massive of Remnant ships can support regular use of these weapons."

	description "Perhaps more important for some are the peripheral improvements over standard reactors. The most obvious improvement is that these generators produce stabilized byproducts suitable for use as hyperdrive fuel on a continuous basis.

Their latest creation combines their rapidly expanding transdimensional theory with new techniques learned from the Wanderer ramscoops. While the Wanderer ramscoop creates a big field to pull in available matter, the Remnant use a set of nine small ramscoops spread out over the periphery of the ship to effectively generate a larger mesh to catch material, which is then rerouted back to a central processing unit. Some Remnant engineers consider this system effectively a way to let their ships breath in space."

When the room isn't otherwise occupied, this module expands out to convert it into a fully fledged laboratory."
	description "	While planetbound scientists might consider it little more than a closet packed with scanners and equipment, to the Remnant it is a base of operations used to investigate alien and stellar phenomena on-site. For captains, having advanced equipment to support their sensor suites as well as a trained scientist to serve in their crew amount to a strong benefit."

Far more important is the ability for their ships to quickly and efficiently enter or exit combat as needed. At the end of the day, it is continued life that is paramount."
	description "	The Bellows-class afterburner embodies this philosophy by providing captains with a tool that allows them to make great leaps of acceleration, typically during evasive maneuvers or to catch up with a fleeing target. Due to their enormous fuel usage, only the most specialized of ships have enough fuel to use these for more than a few seconds at a time before completely running out of fuel."
