Most outfitters are not real 'connoisseurs' of the value these hold though, and would not give you any more than the price of brute gold for it."

	description "This ship was built near the end of the Korath raids to be fast enough to catch and delay the raiders of the time. Whilst ordinarily it could not defeat one alone, its energy weapons and drones let it hold its own until cavalry arrived, and sometimes even win the fight if lucky. It is not able to sustain prolonged combat, but it is now renowned for attacking vulnerable targets in human space and disappearing before anyone can react, as if always one move ahead."
	description "When the raids suddenly ended, this ship turned out to be less useful in the subsequent Unfettered conflict, and was stolen by Mercenaries who chose to remain neutral in the conflict."

	description "The Sea Scorpion was designed to serve as a mobile platform to launch Trackers from. After decades of hard work, the Unfettered are finally able to mass produce them. The ever growing fleet of Sea Scorpions enables the Unfettered to employ new tactics against the other Hai which alleviate some of their numerical, technological, and logistical disadvantages."
	description "This version was built from stronger materials, allowing a stronger hull, at the cost of heat dissipation. The owners also made modifications in order to make this ship more agile, and flexible, with increased fuel and engine capacity. It is a terror on the battlefield, using its speed and high damage of the Tripulse Shredders to its advantage."

Apparently they have been taken by a pirate who pretended to be a merchant, ready to bring them home. The name of the ship is 'The Harpy', and it probably still is in Hai space. You launch as soon as possible to find it, as rumors say that the ship is as fast as a Tari - a very fast small bird from the Hai's home world.`
