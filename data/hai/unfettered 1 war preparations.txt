			`	You seem to have stressed her a bit. "Are you always in a rush?" she asks. "Just look for traces of these particles; it should lead you to them. Based on chemical composition, these particles seem to be coming from the jump drive - it must be malfunctioning, but I have no idea in what way it is. This Auxiliary is no joke - it has room for over 100 crew members, so be sure to have what it takes to capture it. You could always disable it and then come back later to board them; but in that case, make sure to be quick, or else the Alphas could repair it." You remember it also had fighters accompanying it.`
				goto agree

				`	She takes a while to answer, "We never focused too much on capturing ships at any cost, preferring to see the enemy eye to eye and only stun them, so they may live to fight another day but I am sure you humans may have... alternative approaches. Their base is probably isolated, so you could always disable them and come back later with a different ship, or just outfit the one you have differently."`

			`	"The damage was done by some kind of beam weapon, and a very strong one at that. It looks like it only got partially deflected by the shields, if at all. I wonder what kind of weapon can do that." She looks intrigued, and pauses to think about it, then continues, "That would explain why it's forbidden for us to venture east with jump drives. We lack any hull repair capabilities, and to be honest with you, our hull is not much more resilient than the one of some human ships, like that Auxiliary."`
			choice

					goto logs

					goto information
			label logs
			`	"Yes, I noticed on the scanner logs. I would advise not relying too heavily on your shields, but they don't seem to have that many of those weapons, so you should be fine. I do not believe they could have designed such weapons by themselves. They probably just stole them from nearby aliens."`
			choice
				`	"What about the damage on their ship? How is that relevant to my mission?"`
					goto information
				`	"You should have asked me to do an outfit scan, earlier."`
			`	"Maybe, but it could have provoked them further. They apparently like their secrets. I only wanted to know about the structure of the ship, but I'd agree that knowing more about those weapons would be useful. Now, back to the damage on their ship.`
			label information
			`	"Obviously, this amount of damage has consequences. It looks like they've quickly patched it up, so it won't affect their hull resistance to weapon's fire. However, this is interesting," she says, pointing out particles on her pad you have not seen before. "Another captain found weird particles in that same system. We've never found traces of those particles before. I guess it could mean a shot got through and did some damage to one of the jump drives they are carrying - maybe even the one they use to jump. One thing is certain: these particles are not left by normal human ships, or Hai for that matter. My best guess would be that when the ship jumped, the hole it left behind did not close as quickly as it should, and anti-matter came from the other side. Perhaps it left these peculiar particles when being annihilated by contacting matter. Or maybe the particles just came through the opening in space?`
			`	"It doesn't matter much anyway. I suspect that they would have gone back to their base to at least take a look at it, so there should be traces leading to it. Something bothers me about this: from our experience, jump drives either work or explode. Maybe it's because the jump drive is not actually being used, and is only leaking particles passively, that this is possible? Or maybe the damage done by these weapons is really special. After all, they are more advanced than what we have, or what the aliens up north possess. Only the Quarg and Korath have a similar level of technology, and those are the races that are rumoured to have invented the jump drives, so it could be some of these weapons are intended to disrupt it specifically."`
			label agree
			`	You were ready to go, but she seems to have something more to say. "Oh, and one last thing before you leave: the base is probably far away, so I would advise taking some fuel pods, especially considering the damage left on the Auxiliary means you will probably not have much time to wait to fuel up from the local stars either, and you should be ready to jump between systems as fast as possible. Also, be prepared for a fight in space, as well as within the ship itself, to claim it."`

They do not look to be in a state to talk about anything though, so you should probably take them to Darkcloak and talk to the Chiefs about this. Hopefully the Korath will have recovered by then.

			`	You find a few squirrel symbols, and a fist that could indicate they forced them to. The Alphas seem to often communicate using simple symbols for their logs as a primitive code, on top of the more serious encryptions used for sensitive information. Going deeper into these recent logs of activities, you find a monkey symbol, with an eye. But it is not all, there is a symbol of a crossed portal, with a red skull icon.`
			`	There are also multiple flight logs. It seems they had been using this Auxiliary as a mobile base and for bringing jump drives to the Unfettered. These logs probably contain indications of where they have been getting the jump drives, but analyzing all of them will take more time. It doesn't take much, though, to notice they have spent significant time near Korath Exile territory. It is now time to leave the planet and go see the Chiefs.`

She seems to be quite busy making prototypes, or maybe this is just because of the Koraths presence here. After stumbling on what you can only assume to be pieces of scrap, you find her, watching and working with the Koraths. As you wonder who is assisting who, she notices you, "<last>! He-Yi thought you would be quick to come. It is good to see you again, but I guess this is not simply a courtesy visit, you must be here about the prize." As is usual here, her phrases are translated by the crude korath translator.

This new ship... well it is more of a modification than an actual new ship, actually, but anyway even if it is not public knowledge yet, they would not give that information away." You are surprised when one of the Korath makes a very gluteral sound, which, you realize after some time, is probably a laugh.

			`He-Yi joins you on your ship after having parked his. "We will notify you once you may be of more help to the war effort. In the meantime, we have increased your salary to 5,000 credits so you can [muster, gather] an even larger fleet. Also, from now on, you will officially have the permission - nay, the obligation - to proudly wear our [flag, colors]. We have informed the Hai of your new colors so that they will [recognize, distinguish] you and not be hostile to you. We cannot say the same for the Wanderers, though, so be careful."`
			`	He then draws his long sword, which has the same appearance as the keystone pendants popular among his race, and he hands it to you. "You have also deserved the right to have this. It is a proof of our trust toward you and means you will have access to all of our ships. Whenever a warlord is defeated in battle, he has to surrender his sword to the one who vanquished him."`

I cannot tell you much more about it, but rest assured this sword would be more useful than a [gun, simple weapon] for boarding. It was given to me by the council many years ago, matching my [responsibility, task] as well as my character."`

			label tejolis
			`	"Tejolis is the goddess of [strategy, apt thinking], which you could call intelligence. It is the aptitude to make good judgments based on context. For instance, if you have time to choose, a quick decision does not make sense, and a wrong decision is hard to [justify, forgive]. Likewise, when time is of the essence, one must learn to [act, react] quickly or be overwhelmed by the actions of others. I named this ship in her honor and I have a statue of her in my war room because I follow her [teachings, legacy]. All warlord ships are named in reference to specific Gods, and relate to their [intended, supposed] functions."`
				goto questions
			label hull
			`	"As you have probably noticed, the hull is not standard Hai colors. It is, partly, a matter of taste, but the biggest reason is that this ship was built out of the wreck of an old Korath [raider, warship]. Those materials are more sturdy than normal Hai ones, which is why this ship is so [impervious, resilient] to hull damage. However, it comes at the cost of cooling efficiency."`
				goto questions
			label cloak
			`	"Many years ago, when the Korath attacked us, they used a [ghost, fantom] ship. It would attack the [convoys, defenceless], and then disappear without a trace. There was no jump, no flash, nothing. It was just gone. Then, once our warships would depart it returned, always [harassing, plundering] us. The ghost managed to take on countless of convoys and escorts without issue, using its superior [technology, weaponry] and tactical advantages. But it was no real ghost. Everyone has a weakness. Its weakness was that while we could not see it, it did not mean that it was [not there anymore, gone]."`
			`	"With this in mind, the brave Unfettered laid a trap for the ship. When it [disappeared, cloaked], they stopped shooting like usual and acted in distress, making the ghost [arrogant, overconfident]. When it reappeared and moved toward the convoy, we were ready. The fleet arrived and blocked its [escape, cloaking]. The ghost ship disappeared, but it was too late. One of the convoy ships nearby [rammed, crashed] into it, which costed the life of the proud captain but revealed the ship. Then it was just a matter of [shooting it down, damaging it]. The cloaking device was damaged in the fight, or maybe it was already damaged before, knowing the ship never [disappeared, cloaked] for long, so we could not extract it from the wreckage. Instead, we built a ship based on that wreckage's materials, and the [damaged, incomplete] cloaking device remained installed."`

It needs to fully [replace, overwrite] the old system, and that one is well integrated into the ship, so we may have to simply disable it if it cannot be replaced. The engineers are doing all that they can, but it is advanced technology we know [almost nothing, little] about."`

Knowing it could only come from the [automated, soulless] killing machines to the east, I went looking for such weapons under the [assurance, safety] of my cloak. I expected to battle for it, but the killing machines are fighting other killing machines. I just watched them battle from a distance and then swiftly looted a ship... Except it [self destructed, exploded] in my face. So I looked for another one, and that one did not explode. I took the weapon and came home, [proud, victorious]. I had barely enough space in my cargo hold for it."`

Last, I'm sure you know plenty about flamethrowers. They are crude, but [effective, powerful]."`
