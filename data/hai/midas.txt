	description "This ship was designed to repel the raiding ships, near the end of the Korath raids. Whilst it would not be able to defeat one of their ships alone, and would struggle in a prolonged fight, its energy weapons and drone support allow it to hold its own until reinforcements arrive."
	description "	The prototype was stolen after the raids meaning that this ship design was never produced again, given it would be of little use in the Unfettered conflict. Nowadays the Antlion is renowned for attacking vulnerable targets and disappearing before anyone can react, as if always one move ahead."

The ever growing fleet of Sea Scorpions enables the Unfettered to employ new tactics against the other Hai which alleviate some of their numerical, technological, and logistical disadvantages."
	description "	This version was built from stronger materials, allowing a stronger hull, at the cost of heat dissipation. The owners also made modifications in order to make this ship more agile and flexible, with increased fuel and engine capacity. It is a terror on the battlefield, using its speed and high damage of the Tripulse Shredders to its advantage."
