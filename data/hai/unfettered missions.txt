It is grandiose compared to its surroundings, distinguished by its sheer length and pure white appearance. In contrast, most structures around it appear to be bars or houses.

Then they rise up, and one speaks to the crowd, "It is late, you would do well to go home to care for those near you. Never hesitate to come back to us in the next cycle should you need help."

The hospital itself looks different than the rest of the Unfettered structures, it seems more organized, proper. It is probably the best maintained structure here alongside the shipyards, or at least it has that appearance. One part of it looks to have been grafted onto the rest though, it is probably a recent addition. Not even their critical buildings appear to be totally safe from the Unfettered's propensity for haphazard building extensions.`

At one time you spot a local that appeared to have gotten lost from the village, though you get the distinctive impression that something is odd about him, without being able to pinpoint what. As you get closer, more and more you get the impression that it is no simple, small depot. You pass several security turrets and assume that even more defenses are hidden.  You wonder why these turrets would be in plain sight around a "hidden" depot. You start entering a ridge, and you notice some of your surroundings look... weird, like if the mountain had only been affected by the elements at some places and not others. Suddenly, the Hai stops, and raises a hand high up, palm open. Recognizing the sign, you stop.`
			`	The Hai reaches for some kind of device in his pocket and enters what you assume to be the access codes. By the look on his face, it does not seem to be working very well, though...

"Maybe you should come with me after all."`
				goto choose

			`	It may have felt like the right thing to do at the time, but you quickly realize splitting up and then staying here in the open was not very intelligent. It is too late unfortunately, because you get stabbed by a local pirate, who is no longer impressed by your now missing armored friend.`

Still I do not have to guarantee your security in any way, so you are free to do as you wish.

We just have to go in, make sure they recognize us as friends, and then reactivate them." You really wonder where that vault could be, until you notice that part of this mountain in front of you is a hologram to disguise the entry. You both enter the vault.`
			`	At first you do not notice anything suspicious, the vault is clearly alien in origin, but you cannot pinpoint one race, instead it seems to be a mix of many. All of it is very, very old to say the least, and there is no illumination, probably because your friend deactivated the lights, but maybe even before that... At least there is quite some space to move around, enough for an armored vehicle in fact. As you get used to the darkness inside the vault, you finally notice a flash of light, quite far away on your left.`

You are impressed by the precision of that weapon as the sniper was quite clearly taken out with the first shot, but still your armored companion fires three more times.`
			`	After searching through the vault to find other surprises, the area is declared cleared. Any other stalkers have probably run off after seeing the firepower the Hai brought. You then inspect the jump drives to the best of your ability with a device he gave you, whilst he takes care of the security systems.`

More people would have only attracted more attention and caused the pirates to use the vault's defences against us for sure. As you have probably noticed, we did not have access to this vault for quite some time. Some unfettered humans could have snuck in and sabotaged the jump drives, like they did with the turrets."`

Needless to say, even monkeys could rig the jump drives to blow when placed on a ship and used to jump, and checking that takes time. Besides, we want to keep using this vault for later, so we may as well ensure its safety. That said, it seems to be too compromised for further uses."`

Once back to the vault with your ship, you give the orders to collect and simply transfer the jump drives in cargo or rather install them directly on your ship if possible, to be able to flee more swifly.`
			`	A bit later the Hai comes to speak to you on the bridge. "It took us too long to install the jump drives, and we seem to have attracted attention. I guess that if some of the unfettered humans got away from the vault, they have contacted some friends..." Multiple alarms start going off, confirm his suspicions. Multiple hostile ships are launching and heading straight for you. You launch as soon as you can, rushing through the correct procedures.`

Heading that way you find a brig with Koraths in itm and a very peculiar symbol over it, that looks like a lizard's head. They seem to have been prisoners of the Alphas, and you find what appears to be a crudely rigged translation device with them. They do not look to be in a state to talk about anything though, so you should probably go to Darkcloak and talk to the Chiefs about this. Hopefully the Korath will have recovered by then.`

It seems the Alphas had big plans for these prisoners, as you see the lizard head symbol from earlier on many log entries but the details are so well encrypted there is no hope learning more any time soon.

Thankfully you were tougher than they anticipated and secured victory for yourself. Did the Unfettered know about this? You find a few squirrel symbols, and a fist that could indicate they forced them to. The Alphas seem to often communicate using simple symbols for their logs, as a primitive way of encryption, on top of the more serious encryptions used for sensitive information.`
			`	There are also multiple flight logs. It seems they had been using this Auxiliary as a mobile base, and for bringing jump drives to the Unfettered. So maybe you did indeed find the Alpha base, after all! These logs probably contain indications of where they have been getting the Jump Drives, but analyzing all of them will take more time. It doesn't take much, though, to notice they seemed to spend quite some time near the Korath Exiles' territory. It is now time to leave the planet and go see the Chiefs.`

That by itself seemed like a too good opportunity to let go, our captain was anxious to get on it and get renomn for capturing such a ship. Also given we were in a cruiser, we did not fear the crew of such a small ship. But we were wrong: as soon as we boarded said ship we knew something was wrong. But we were committed so we went in anyway. Being a soldier, I was on the frontline, and I saw things... Things you do not want to see, trust me. I saw people falling for no apparent reason, out of a sudden. But that was not the worst of it. As you can see, I have survived, and that by itself is terrifying. They shot me! They shot me, yet I lived, and the feelings I had when shot where weird to say the least..."`

His weakness was that whilst we could not see it, it did not mean that it was not there anymore."`

When it disappeared they stopped shooting like usual, and made him overconfident, doing confused movements, dropping part of their cargo as if they were in distress. So he reappeared He saw the other ships coming in but did not react to them in time and got close - too close - to the convoy. Once the fleet arrived, he disappeared but it was too late for him and his limited agility. One of the convoy ships near him rammed him, which costed the life of the proud captain but revealed the ship. Then it was just a matter of shooting it down. The cloaking device was damaged in the fight, or maybe it was already damaged before, knowing the ship never cloaked for long, so we could not extract it from the wreckage. Instead we built a ship based on that wreckage's materials, and the cloaking device is a part of it."`
