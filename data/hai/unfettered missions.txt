You then present yourself to her, and right after that the proceedings resume. A child approaches the Chiefs, and he speaks very quietly, as if afraid. He appears lost. One of the Chief comes close to him and reassures him before speaking to his request. Merora then translates it to you, "The child wishes to return home, to Hai space. However he cannot do that alone, and the Chief is asking for someone to escort him and find him a suitable transport. All Hai captains, even those who do not sympathise with our cause, would easily accept taking a child back to Hai space, without asking anything in return. It only needs to be arranged by someone, and the child does not know who to turn to." Progressively, every single Hai stands up and says what you're pretty sure means "I do" in Hai. The Chief seems very moved by this, as a parent would be to see his child succeed in life. He then designates one, and the child goes to them.`

Merora tells you, "He made a simple request, which bothers the Chiefs quite a bit, as he is not asking for a child to be transported, but for a full family, and not into Hai space but here, and there are not as many captains ready to do that. The Chief said that currently no one is available. They will most probably go and ask captains if it can be arranged, later." Then the Chiefs rise up, and one speaks to the crowd.

			`	Before exiting, he warns you, "Whatever happens, do not try anything stupid, and stay behind me at all times."`
			`	Once outside, you head for the mountains with him. He moves at a quick pace, and you have difficulties following him, especially with the terrain. He seems worried and keeps looking around furtively, making as little sound as possible with his suit. He is impressively stealthy all things considered, and you surmise the suit must have been crafted specifically for him in order to be so discreet. He presses a switch every so often which pops out a mirror, allowing him to peer cautiously around corners and obstacles in your path in case of an ambush.`
			`	You quickly arrive by a small local town that seems pretty recent. It's constructed with metal and other scraps the builders could gather, and is as deprecated as it gets.`

				`	"There is no need to be worried, that cache is well hidden."`

			`	You are not sure what kind of sign he just did, but it seems pretty clear he wants you to keep quiet. Looking around, you notice the two of you have attracted quite a bit of attention from the locals. While they all seem to have nothing to lose, the vast majority of them are very young and probably not the hardened criminals you had expected.`
			label discreet
			`	You both seem to be heading to a distant mountain, where you assume the cache is. On the way, you spot a local that appears to have gotten lost from the village, though you get the distinctive impression that something is odd about him, without being able to pinpoint what. As you get closer, more and more you get the impression that this vault no simple, small depot. You pass several security turrets and assume that even more defenses are hidden.  You wonder why these turrets would be in plain sight around a "hidden" depot. You cross a ridge, and you notice some of your surroundings look... weird, like the mountain has only been affected by the elements at some places and not others. Suddenly, the Hai stops and raises a hand high up, palm open. Recognizing the sign, you stop.`
			`	The Hai reaches for some kind of device in his pocket and enters what you assume to be access codes. By the look on his face, it doesn't seem to be working very well. "Someone else has accessed the vault. This was not expected," he hisses as his grip tightens on his weapon and he dons his helmet. "Stay here. I will take care of it."`

					goto wannafight
				`	"What about the locals? They don't seem friendly. I just saw one nearby."`
			`	"Those lowlife scums? They would not attempt attacking a well-equipped warrior. Furthermore, there shouldn't be any around here, so far away from the village." He steps forward but then glances back at you, unprotected and armed only with a laser that seems like a toy in comparison to his. "Maybe you should come with me after all."`
				goto choose
			label wannafight
			`	"If the vault was compromised, it was not by amateurs. I fear those inside are more dangerous and well-armed than the locals. Still, I do not have to guarantee your security in any way, so you are free to do as you wish. The defense mechanisms are offline at the moment, so you would have to fend for yourself, but the locals are so young or frail that even you should manage it." You hear a tone of provocation in the last words.`
			label choose
			choice
				`	(Stay outside.)`
					goto outside
				`	(Come in.)`
			`	He sighs. "As you wish, but I hope you can take care of yourself on the ground as well as in space. I have disabled the automated defenses just in case they have been hijacked. We just have to go in, make sure they recognize us as friends, and then reactivate them." You really wonder where the vault could be, until you notice that part of this mountain in front of you is a hologram to disguise the entry. You both enter.`
			`	At first, you don't notice anything suspicious. The vault is clearly alien in origin, but you cannot pinpoint one race; instead it seems to be a mix of many. All of it is very, very old, and there is no illumination, probably because your friend deactivated the lights, but maybe even before that... At least there is space to move around - enough for an armored vehicle, in fact. As you acclimate to the darkness inside the vault, you notice a flash of light, far away on your left.`
			choice
				`	(It's just a light flickering. No need to worry.)`
				`	"GET DOWN!"`
					goto down
			`	It was indeed just a light flickering - from a laser sight, used to acquire a target: you.`

			label outside
			`	It may have felt like the right thing to do at the time, but you quickly realize splitting up and then staying here in the open was not very intelligent. It is too late, unfortunately, because you get stabbed by a local pirate, who is no longer impressed by your now-missing armored friend.`
				die
			label down
			`	You get down yourself as you give the warning, then look his way to see if he followed it. The Unfettered was evidently trained for this, as he is already on the ground and sighting his rifle. You're impressed by the precision of that weapon as the sniper was quite clearly taken out with the first shot, but your armored companion fires three more times to be sure.`
			`	After searching through the vault to find other surprises, the area is declared cleared. Any other stalkers have probably run off after seeing the firepower the Hai brought. You then inspect the jump drives to the best of your ability with a device he gave you while he takes care of the security systems.`
			choice
				`	(Go back to the ship.)`
					goto ship
				`	"We could have just come into the vault swarming with ground forces instead of risking our lives..."`
				`	"Why did we have to go into the vault instead of just connecting it to the ship earlier?"`
					goto vault
			`	"We needed to act discreetly so we would have the time to check the status of the jump drives without being swarmed by opportunist pirates. More people would have only attracted more attention and caused the pirates to use the vault's defenses against us for sure. As you have probably noticed, we did not have access to this vault for quite some time. Some unfettered humans could have snuck in and sabotaged the jump drives, like they did with the turrets."`
				goto ship
			label vault
			`	"We needed to make sure there was not any malfunctions with them, and that the vault was not compromised, as its defenses could probably have taken your ship down. Needless to say, even monkeys could rig the jump drives to blow when placed on a ship and used to jump, and checking that takes time. Besides, we want to keep using this vault for later, so we may as well ensure its safety. That said, it seems to be too compromised for further uses."`
			choice
				`	(Go back to the ship.)`
					goto ship
				`	"If this world is so wild, why put the jump drives here in the first place?"`
			`	"The Unfettered are not the ones who placed those jump drives here..." He leaves it at that. The Hai doesn't seem to want to tell you much about this vault.`
			
			label ship
			`	As you head back to your ship, you notice more activity than on the way in. He keeps his rifle well in sight in order to dissuade any potential attackers. Once back to the vault with your ship, you give the orders to collect and either transfer the jump drives into cargo or install them directly on your ship if possible, to be able to flee more swifly.`
			`	A bit later, the Hai comes to speak to you on the bridge. "It took us too long to transfer and install the jump drives, and we seem to have attracted attention. I guess if some of the unfettered humans got away from the vault, they have contacted some friends..." Multiple alarms start going off, confirming his suspicions. Multiple hostile ships are launching and heading straight for you. You launch as soon as you can, rushing through the correct procedures.`

We've never found traces of those particles before. I guess it could mean a shot got through and did some damage to one of the jump drives they are carrying - maybe even the one they use to jump. One thing is certain: these particles are not left by normal human ships, or Hai for that matter. My best guess would be that when the ship jumped, the hole it left behind did not close as quickly as it should, and anti-matter came from the other side. Perhaps it left these peculiar particles when being annihilated by contact with matter. Or maybe the particles just came through the opening in space?`
			`	"It doesn't matter much anyway. I suspect that they would have gone back to their base to at least take a look at it, so there should be traces leading to it. Something bothers me about this: from our experience, jump drives either work or explode, without any in between. Maybe it's because the jump drive is not actually being used, and only leaking particles passively, that this is possible? Or maybe the damage done by these weapons is really special. After all, they are more advanced than what we have, or what the aliens up north possess. Only Quargs have a similar level of technology, and they invented the jump drives, so it could be some of these weapons are intended to disrupt it specifically."`

Also, be prepared for a fight in space, as well as within the ship itself, to claim it."`

Maybe they have not seen this Auxiliary yet, but only heard tales of it, or maybe this is what always happens when it lands, loaded with jump drives.

When he stands, you see many scars on his arms, and can only guess what he went through. He speak calmly, yet firmly, strongly enough to make everyone listen. "We have lost much, so much. Too much... But so have they. And the raids happened long ago. They could not have been responsible for those. They are victims of that war as much as we are. They should be considered assets at the very least, not prisoners. They could help us against the soulless killers." This mention set off much murmuring, you can feel that not everyone agrees with what he said, but he has enough influence that they will not argue about it, at least for now. You wonder what the soulless killers could be, but feel like now is not the time to ask.`

They could be hidden, so you proceed cautiously, looking for the jump drive vault. On the way you hear sounds - sounds that definitely did not originate from humans. Heading that way, you find a brig full of Korath slaves, with a lizard head displayed above the cells. They seem to have been prisoners of the Alphas, and you find what appears to be a crudely rigged translation device with them. They do not look to be in a state to talk about anything though, so you should probably go to Darkcloak and talk to the Chiefs about this. Hopefully the Korath will have recovered by then.`

Did the Unfettered know about this, or did Taer-Fi really think it was a jump drive malfunction? You find a few squirrel symbols, and a fist that could indicate they forced them to. The Alphas seem to often communicate using simple symbols for their logs as a primitive method of encryption, on top of the more serious encryptions used for sensitive information.`
			`	There are also multiple flight logs. It seems they had been using this Auxiliary as a mobile base and for bringing jump drives to the Unfettered. These logs probably contain indications of where they have been getting the jump drives, but analyzing all of them will take more time. It doesn't take much, though, to notice they have spent significant time near Korath Exile territory. It is now time to leave the planet and go see the Chiefs.`

			`	"Tejolis is the goddess of apt thinking, which you could call intelligence. It is the aptitude to make good judgments based on context. For instance, if you have time to choose, a quick decision does not make sense, and a wrong decision is hard to justify. Likewise, when time is of the essence, one must learn to act quickly or be overwhelmed by the actions of others. I named this ship in her honor and I have a statue of her in my war room because I follow her teachings."`

			label hull
			`	"As you have probably noticed, the hull is not standard Hai colors. It is, partly, a matter of taste, but the biggest reason is that this ship was built out of the wreck of an old Korath warship. Those materials are more sturdy than normal Hai ones, which is why this ship is so resilient to hull damage."`
				goto questions
			label cloak
			`	"Many years ago, when the Korath attacked us, they used a ghost ship. It would attack the convoys, and then disappear without a trace. There was no jump, no flash, nothing. It was just gone. Then, once our warships would depar it returned, always harassing us. The ghost managed to take on countless of convoys and escorts without issue, using its superior technology and tactical advantages. But it was no real ghost. Everyone has a weakness. Its weakness was that while we could not see it, it did not mean that it was not there anymore."`
			`	"With this in mind, the brave Unfettered laid a trap for the ship. When it disappeared, they stopped shooting like usual and acted in distress, making the ghost overconfident. When it reappeared and moved toward the convoy, we were ready. The fleet arrived and blocked its escape. The ghost ship disppeared, but it was too late. One of the convoy ships nearby rammed into it, which costed the life of the proud captain but revealed the ship. Then it was just a matter of shooting it down. The cloaking device was damaged in the fight, or maybe it was already damaged before, knowing the ship never cloaked for long, so we could not extract it from the wreckage. Instead, we built a ship based on that wreckage's materials, and the damaged cloaking device remained installed."`
