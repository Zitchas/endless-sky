			`Looking outside, you see the sun is setting. You take a moment to admire the breathtaking view of the sun passing trough some clouds of pollution and notice a large, white, square-shaped structure in the distance, perhaps some sort of stadium, which a growing crowd of Unfettered are streaming towards. Ships keep landing and unloading even more Hai all over the spaceport, so much so that, exiting your ship, you cannot avoid being caught up in it, almost carried, as they head towards the building. It is grandiose compared to its surroundings, distinguished by its sheer length and pure white appearance. In contrast, most of the surrounding structures appear to be houses or bars, all with more dilapidated appearances.`
			`	Something of great interest must be happening in this building, but not all the Unfettered in the crowd actually share your destination; many are instead breaking away to fill the nearby bars. Some simply wander aimlessly, others are sitting on the rocky ground, chatting. Quite a few of them appear to be trading a small quantity of goods between themselves.`
			choice
				`	(Go into the stadium.)`
				`	(Ignore them and go back to my ship.)`
					defer
			`	Moving with the crowd towards the nearest stadium entrance, a large wide open corridor leading directly into the seating areas around the main pavilion, you begin to hear words being spoken loudly, probably amplified by some kind of device. Given that the Hai are generally quite small in comparison to humans, while waiting to filter inside you can already see some of what is going on inside over most of the crowd. It seems much of the line is not for the seating itself; it instead heads directly to the central stage where a group of official-looking Unfettered Hai await. They are approached by the next in line, a couple towing four children with them, who begin to plead, <firstgroup>. The officials, perhaps the "Chiefs" you have heard lead the Unfettered, speak among themselves, then, together, perform a gesture as they turn back to the petitioners. By the relief on their faces, you assume their request has been granted.`
			`	The next in line seems quite old, but he is moving around proudly, as if not limited by his age at all. <secondgroup> For him to speak this way, this soldier clearly has some special status or a reputation which has earned great respect. Or maybe he just exemplifies what you've heard about the ways of the Unfettered; they bow to no one.`
			`	The soldier moves away, and a tense silence hangs in the air for a moment. The Chiefs turn from the audience to speak among themselves, while mutterings and debate seem to be spreading throughout the crowd. This subject appears something for which strong opinions are held. The volume increases as the Chiefs continue their aside, and you begin to notice some of the nearby Hai turning their attention towards you, some even pointing you out. It may be that you are not welcome here. One of the younger Hai to notice you, probably still an adolescent judging by her colors, approaches you directly. She speaks softly, in your language, but clearly enough to be heard over the back and forth murmuring in the crowd. "Hi. I have noticed you easily among Hai. Do you want me to help translate what they say?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, thank you."`
					goto translate
				`	"Thank you, but I already understand what I need to."`
				`	"I have no need of help."`
			`	She seems a bit offended you do not wish her help, but does not press the matter further and proceeds to move away. Most of the Hai here are with what seems to be families or groups of friends, but you do not see your would-be helper join anyone else as she returns to her previous spot in the shifting audience.`

				`	"Yes, please."`
					goto translate
				`	"No, but I did not mean to offend you, so I came to excuse myself."`

			`	"Alright. I am Merora, by the way. I came to Unfettered space after I lost my parents to pirates, just a few weeks ago. I have not yet integrated well, so I know what it feels like to be isolated here." You begin to introduce yourself to her in turn, but barely get your name out before you are both distracted as the proceedings resume. A child, younger, or at least smaller, than any other you've seen on stage so far, approaches the Chiefs. Also alone, the child seems scared and perhaps even lost as he speaks, so softly even those on stage must be straining to hear. One of the Chiefs breaks ranks to kneel by the child, comforting him as they speak quietly to each other. The Chief rises and turns to those watching to share the child's words, and Merora then translates it to you, "The child wishes to return home, to Hai space. However he cannot manage alone, and the Chief is asking for someone to escort him or find him a suitable transport. All Hai captains, even those who do not otherwise sympathize with our cause, would easily accept taking a child back to Hai space, without ever asking anything in return. It only needs to be arranged by someone, as the child does not know who to turn to." Progressively, most of the Hai present stand up, the message from each to volunteer clear. The Chief seems very moved by this, as a parent would be to see his child succeed in life. He designates one of the first to stand, and gently sends the child walking over to them.`
			`	The sun is almost set, and you can see that the Chiefs are beginning to grow impatient as the next Hai approaches and speaks to them. Merora tells you, "This request bothers the Chiefs quite a bit, as he is not asking for a child to be transported but a full family, and not from here into Hai space but the opposite. A lot more money can be required to bring Hai here, because whilst many captains agree to bring us food for free, they prefer not to bring us more Hai, since for some it would mean condemning them to know hunger as well. There are not as many captains ready to do this. The Chief said that currently no one is available, at least not at a suitable price. Later, they will most probably go and personally ask captains if it can be arranged." While Merora was speaking, the Chiefs had spoken amongst themselves briefly, and now one has moved forward to address the crowd. Merora translates again, "It is over. Goodbye, <first>, I hope we meet again."`

"Even if we fight with the Elders, it does not mean we hate other Hai, nor do they hate us! We do it only because we must, in order to keep living our way.

He presses a switch every so often which pops out a mirror, allowing him to peer cautiously around corners and obstacles in your path in case of an ambush.`

Though he did not seem to be following you, something seems odd about him, but you cannot pinpoint what. Continuing up the mountain, more and more you get the impression that this vault is no simple, small depot. This is confirmed when you pass several security turrets, and, while it safe to assume that even more defenses are hidden, you wonder why any would be left in plain sight around a "hidden" depot. Crossing a ridge, you begin to notice that some of your surroundings look strange, as the mountain has only been affected by the elements in some places and not others. Suddenly, the armored Hai stops and raises a hand high, palm open. Recognizing the sign, you stop as well.`

You really wonder where the vault could be, until you see the Hai walk right through part of the mountain in front of you. It must be a hologram to disguise the entry! You hurry to follow behind him.`
			`	At first, you don't notice anything particularly suspicious, but you do hear the low hum of running electronics and machinery in the distance. Though the vault is clearly alien in origin, you cannot pinpoint one race; instead, it seems to be a mix of many. All of it is very, very old, and there is no illumination, possibly because your friend deactivated the lights along with the turrets, though you don't see why why he would. Even without it, you can tell there is clearly is space to move around - enough for an armored vehicle, in fact.

You can see his bloody knife, with what seems to be a snake on it, before losing consciousness.`

			`	After searching through the vault to eliminate any other surprises, the Hai declares the area cleared. Any other stalkers have probably run off after seeing the firepower your Unfettered friend carries. You then inspect the Jump Drives to the best of your ability with a device he quickly instructed you how to use, while he finishes taking care of the security systems. While waiting for him to return once you are done, you look around and notice a small symbol in the lower corner of a nearby wall: a dog with multiple heads. You double-check the Jump Drives as you continue to wait, and when the Hai captain comes back, he conveniently places his gun to hide the symbol. Best not ask him about it.`
			`	He switches a lever, and the electric humming you've been hearing suddenly stops. "I have disabled the holographic field generator, so yer ship can come to pick up the drives.

More people would have only attracted more attention and been more targets for the vault's defenses against. As ye have probably noticed, we have not accessed this vault for quite some time.

We also needed to make sure the Jump Drives were not sabotaged and that the vault defenses were not compromised; they could probably have taken yer ship down. Needless to say, even monkeys could rig the Jump Drives to blow when used. Checking that takes time. Besides, we want to be using this vault later, so may as well ensure its safety. That said, it seems we left it sit too long, it be too compromised for further use." You have a hunch that there could be more to all this than what he's admitting.`

I guess a lookout got away from the vault and contacted some friends..." Multiple alarms start going off, confirming his suspicions - hostile ships are launching and heading straight for you. You launch as soon as you can, rushing through the correct procedures. Meanwhile, the Unfettered captain joins you on the bridge, clearly used to being where the action is, invited or not.`

It now seems to us that the design is... interesting, so we want you to scan it."`
