There was no jump, no flash, nothing. It was just gone. Then, once our warships would depart it returned, always [harassing, plundering] us. The ghost managed to take on countless of convoys and escorts without issue, using its superior [technology, weaponry] and tactical advantages. But it was no real ghost. Everyone has a weakness. Its weakness was that while we could not see it, it did not mean that it was [not there anymore, gone]."`
			`	"With this in mind, the brave Unfettered laid a trap for the ship. When it [disappeared, cloaked], they stopped shooting like usual and acted in distress, making the ghost [arrogant, overconfident]. When it reappeared and moved toward the convoy, we were ready. The fleet arrived and blocked its [escape, cloaking]. The ghost ship disappeared, but it was too late. One of the convoy ships nearby [rammed, crashed] into it, which costed the life of the proud captain but revealed the ship. Then it was just a matter of [shooting it down, damaging it]. The cloaking device was damaged in the fight, or maybe it was already damaged before, knowing the ship never [disappeared, cloaked] for long, so we could not extract it from the wreckage. Instead, we built a ship based on that wreckage's materials, and the [damaged, incomplete] cloaking device remained installed."`

It needs to fully [replace, overwrite] the old system, and that one is well integrated into the ship, so we may have to simply disable it if it cannot be replaced.

She may accept a payment instead, but do remember, we are not willing to pay a fortune for this item. If you cannot face her, you may have to use quite a large sum of your own money.`

She may not know about it yet, but the officers of the previous warlord probably will - and those officers are now hers. Also, you shouldn't worry about how to identify said item. It is... unique.
