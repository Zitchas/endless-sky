	description "The Mining Drone uses only battery power.  These drones were first used in frontier worlds during the early days of the Republic.  This companion helped miners gather materials from asteroids.  Due to their lightweight design the Navy repurposed these drones for surveillance adding armor to their hull and installing an energy generator for long-term mission independence."
